# Daily Engineering Log – 2025-06-15

## What we accomplished today

* Netlify now serves the latest 20-article batch (front-end switched to `rolling_articles.json`).
* Added quick-guard & prod-smoke CI layers – faster feedback & live deploy check.
* Implemented **Checkpoint-Resume (CR) system**: atomic `temp/batch_WIP.json`, resume logic in `AI-Engine`, artifact upload/restore in workflow.

## Pain points / issues encountered

* Front-end was still loading `test_articles.json`, causing stale content.
* Need better quality "simplified" headings generated by AI.

## Action items for today (2025-06-15)

1. **Improve simplified heading quality** (work on `ai-improve` branch)
   * Audit a sample of bad vs. good titles.
   * Refine `scripts/AI-Engine.py` prompt (explicit length / style rules, examples).
   * Add unit test that fails if heading still contains long proper-noun phrases > X chars.
2. **Fast iteration harness**
   * Add `--sample-size N` flag to `generate_sample_batch.py` to speed local runs.
   * Save each partial result to `temp/` for manual review.
3. **Carry-over high-priority** (from 2025-06-14)
   * Checkpoint & resume mechanism for article generation.
   * Upload generated JSON as workflow artifact.
