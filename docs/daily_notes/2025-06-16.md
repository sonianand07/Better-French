+++ Afternoon updates (local dev) +++

• Commit 9183179 on `ai-improve` sets `quality_repair.py` default `--limit` to **0 (unlimited)** and integrates the repair & rolling collection rebuild directly into `scheduler_main.py --once`.
• Local one-shot runs now mirror CI order and prioritise newest articles.
• Optional: remove duplicate repair/rolling steps from `.github/workflows/auto-update.yml` for faster CI.
