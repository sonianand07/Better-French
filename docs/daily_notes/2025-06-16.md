# Daily Notes – 2025-06-16

| # | Task | Purpose / Details | Status |
|---|------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Verify today's Auto-Update run finishes green | Confirms the `quality_repair` import fix solved yesterday's failure. | ⏳ In Progress |
| 2 | Review AI-Engine data-collection flow | Break-news batch & regular batch should merge into one pass for simplicity and speed. | ❌ Todo |
| 3 | Re-order workflow: run quality_repair **before** website update | Prevents the site from ever publishing un-patched JSON. | ⏳ In Review – scheduler path fixed; YAML cleanup pending |
| 4 | Drop `--limit` or iterate newest-first in `quality_repair.py` | Makes sure today's articles get priority | ✅ Done – default unlimited, newest-first |
| 5 | Add CI check: every title must contain ≥ 1 contextual word span | Smoke test fails if a card has no green words | ❌ Todo |
| 6 | Make "Commit & push" depend on repair success | Stops half-processed data from deploying | ❌ Todo |
| 7 | Watch next scheduled cron run + Netlify deploy | Double-check everything works in production | ⏳ Waiting |
| 8 | Tune prompt & retries (carry-over) | Better coverage & explanations quality | ⏳ Pending |
| 9 | Wire `quality_repair.py` deeper into GitHub Actions (carry-over) | Auto-runs every time without manual trigger | ⏳ Pending |
|10 | Run large batch + archive metrics (carry-over) | Measure quality & cost after fixes | ⏳ Pending |
|11 | Consider beginner/intermediate/advanced layers (carry-over) | Possible future expansion | ⏸ Deferred |

+++ Afternoon updates (local dev) +++

• Commit 9183179 on `ai-improve` sets `quality_repair.py` default `--limit` to **0 (unlimited)** and integrates the repair & rolling collection rebuild directly into `scheduler_main.py --once`.
• Local one-shot runs now mirror CI order and prioritise newest articles.
• Optional: remove duplicate repair/rolling steps from `.github/workflows/auto-update.yml` for faster CI.

### AI-Engine Pipeline Improvement Sprint (kick-off)

| Ref | Task | Purpose / Details | Status |
|-----|------|-------------------|--------|
| AIE-01 | Baseline health audit of AI-Engine pipeline | Collect logs, failure counts & cost metrics from the last 7 days; identify bottlenecks & break-points. Forms foundation for future refactors. | ⏳ In Progress |
| AIE-02 | Define unified JSON schema & dataclass for articles | Single source-of-truth for all stages (curated → display_ready) to eliminate field-mismatch bugs. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-03 | Add automated schema validation in CI | Fail fast if any pipeline step outputs non-conformant JSON. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-04 | Introduce `display_ready` flag + two-file strategy (`pending_articles.json`, `rolling_articles.json`) | Prevent raw stories from ever leaking to the public feed. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-05 | Standardise `call_openrouter_api` return shape + add robust retry/back-off | Avoid downstream branching and silent skips. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-06 | Externalise prompts into Jinja templates | Easier iteration and A/B testing without code edits. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-07 | Parallel batch-processing with rate-limit guard | Cut end-to-end latency; keep within provider QPS limits. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-08 | Response caching by (model, prompt hash) | Re-use identical prompts to save tokens & time. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-09 | Expand inline validator (coverage, JSON size, unicode) | Detect truncated or partial outputs early; auto-repair if possible. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-10 | Reinstate unit/QA tests for key AI-Engine functions | Prevent regressions; tests were deleted in cleanup. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-11 | Add post-AI smoke test: each article must have ≥1 contextual word span & both summaries within spec | Guards against blank or duplicate titles in production. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-12 | Update scheduler to process newest curated articles immediately after curation | Shorten raw→enhanced lag to minutes. | ❌ Todo |
| AIE-13 | Document cost-control hooks (placeholder) | Prepare for future token-budget optimisation once functional stability achieved. | ⏸ Deferred |

(Additional AIE tasks will be scheduled after AIE-01 results are reviewed.)
