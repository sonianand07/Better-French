# 20 June 2025 – Daily log

## Highlights

* Keyword banks expanded (civic + admin terms).
* Added France-wide fallback rule (headline contains "france/français" → relevance 7).
* Lowered Curator gate from 14 → 12 (env `BF_MIN_RULE_SCORE`).
* Raised per-run publication cap to 10 (`BF_PER_RUN_CAP`).
* Implemented 24-hour overflow queue (`overflow.json`) so high-scoring surplus articles are published in later runs.
* README updated accordingly.

## Outstanding / next-up

1. Back-fill contextual-word coverage and reinstate ≥80 % threshold.
2. Monitor queue size & LLM cost after the first 24 h with new settings.
3. Add score/time visualisation to help tune decay rate.
4. Consider per-bucket caps (work / world / general) once real traffic arrives.
5. House-keeping: reorganise the repo structure (remove deprecated v2 artefacts, prune stale raw/backup JSONs, and consolidate website data dirs) so new contributors can navigate it easily.
