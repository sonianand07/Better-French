# Daily Engineering Log – 2025-06-27

## What we accomplished today

* Fixed GitHub Pages not refreshing: auto-update workflow now deploys directly (peaceiris/actions-gh-pages).
* Confirmed new run publishes fresh JSON → site now shows ~90 % contextual-word coverage.
* Performed qualitative audit of v3 simplified titles, summaries and glossary entries against v2 "good_examples".

## Pain points / issues encountered

* Residual filler tokens still appear in `contextual_title_explanations` (articles, punctuation).
* Some nuance lost in simplified titles (e.g. specific trade items dropped).
* Cultural notes sparsely populated (~15 %).
* Occasional missing tokens just after a colon (~10 % headlines).

## Task tracker

| Task | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Integrate GH Pages deploy into auto-update workflow | Ensure instant website refresh after each batch | ✅ Done |
| Qualitative audit of v3 text output | Identify translation/gloss gaps vs. v2 quality bar | ✅ Done |
| Filter low-value tokens in validator | Remove articles/punctuation from gloss map | 🚧 In Progress |
| Prompt tweak to improve token coverage & cultural notes | Recover post-colon words and enrich cultural context | ❌ Pending |

## Action items for tomorrow

1. Update `validator.py` to drop single-letter articles and punctuation from `contextual_title_explanations`.
2. In `processor._render_explain_prompt`, seed token list with both full title and post-colon clause to capture missing words.
3. Add prompt reminder: "If relevant, include a one-sentence cultural fact (aim for ≥30 % tokens).".
4. Extend QA rule: fail if >20 % of glossary keys are filler tokens.
