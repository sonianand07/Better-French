# Daily Engineering Log – 2025-06-19

## What we accomplished today

* Cleared stale v3 caches and rewired qualifier to only ingest new *_delta.json files – backlog issue fixed.
* Added human-friendly logging for LLM scoring & curator steps.
* Promoted **ai_engine_v3** to active pipeline; marked **ai_engine_v2** as legacy via README_LEGACY.
* Implemented state file bootstrap so first-run skips historical data.
* Fixed qualifier→processor schema mismatch; pipeline now processes and publishes new articles end-to-end.
* Added environment overrides (BF_MIN_RULE_SCORE, BF_DAILY_CAP) for rapid QA.
* Introduced local preview flag (`--serve`) that spins up http.server (port 8010-8020).
* Wrote dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`v3-ci`) that lint/tests v3 only and runs a smoke pipeline.
* Ported essential unit tests to `tests/ai_engine_v3`; updated pytest config to ignore v2.

## Pain points / issues encountered

* Historical raw_scrape archives caused >10 k articles in first run.
* Pydantic validation errors due to missing/extra fields when converting curator output.
* Daily cap reached prevented second batch from publishing; clarified workflow.
* Apple-touch icon 404s when serving locally (cosmetic).

## Task tracker

| Task | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Rename/ create branch `ai-engine-v3-main` and set as default | Finalise project structure | ⬜️ Todo |
| Move v2 code under `legacy/` or tag v2.99 | prevent accidental edits | ⬜️ Todo |
| Update Netlify / production deploy scripts to pull v3 website directory | seamless prod rollout | ⬜️ Todo |
| Add cron/scheduler entry for fetch+qualify v3 | unattended runs | ⬜️ Todo |
| Expand v3 test coverage (scraper, curator, storage) | confidence | ⬜️ Todo |
| Wire cost-tracking metrics into CI artifact | budget monitoring | ⬜️ Todo |
| Clean up 404 icons & add favicon to website root | polish local preview | ⬜️ Todo |
| Update docs (README, ROADMAP) to reference v3 | developer onboarding | ⬜️ Todo |

## Action items for tomorrow

1. Create `ai-engine-v3-main` branch, push, open PR → set default.
2. Move `ai_engine_v2` directory into `legacy/` and adjust import paths only inside v2 tests (skip in pytest).
3. Add GitHub Action for nightly scheduled v3 pipeline run with dry-run mode.
4. Prepare Netlify preview branch pointing at `ai_engine_v3/website`.
5. Draft documentation updates.

## File change log (why)

| File | Type | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| ai_engine_v3/scripts/qualify_news.py | edit | incremental only ingestion, schema fix, better logging |
| ai_engine_v2/README_LEGACY.md | new | mark v2 as frozen |
| .github/workflows/ci.yml | new | v3-only CI pipeline |
| tests/ai_engine_v3/* | new | ported unit tests |
| pytest.ini | new | ignore v2 tests |

## Evening updates – Netlify & Deployment

* Installed **Netlify CLI** locally via `npm` into `$HOME/.npm-global` (no sudo required).
* Generated a **personal access token** (PAT) in Netlify → User → *Applications* → *New access token*.
  * Token is exported in shell: `export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="nlt_…"`.
* Added CLI bin directory to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"`.
* Using the CLI we will automate:
  1. Update site `c482cb0d-1ae5-4986-97e8-09948ae2eb3e` to use
     * `repo_branch`: **ai-engine-v3-main**
     * `publish`: **ai_engine_v3/website**
  2. Trigger on-demand deploys: `netlify trigger --branch ai-engine-v3-main`.
* This removes the manual clicks in the UI and guarantees future deploys pull the correct branch/folder.
* Next action when token is ready:
  ```bash
  netlify api updateSite --data '{
    "site_id":"c482cb0d-1ae5-4986-97e8-09948ae2eb3e",
    "build_settings":{
      "repo_branch":"ai-engine-v3-main",
      "publish":"ai_engine_v3/website"
    }}'
  netlify trigger --branch ai-engine-v3-main
  ```
* Once the deploy finishes, the live site will show the 25 fresh v3 articles and future hourly runs will update automatically.

## Wrap-up (end of day)

Today we:
1. Fixed OpenRouter 401s by updating secret, then verified successful hourly run.
2. Disabled legacy v2 workflows and granted `contents: write` to auto-update.
3. Pointed Netlify production branch → `ai-engine-v3-main` and publish dir → `ai_engine_v3/website`.
4. Installed Netlify CLI, documented setup, and updated README with full v3 handbook.
5. Confirmed live site now serves 20 fresh v3 articles, ordered newest-first.

## Action items for tomorrow (2025-06-20)

- [ ] **Persist per-run leftovers** – design a buffer so high-scoring articles beyond the 5/hour cap are reconsidered in subsequent runs (no good story left behind).
