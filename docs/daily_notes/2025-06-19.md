# Daily Engineering Log – 2025-06-19

## What we accomplished today

* Cleared stale v3 caches and rewired qualifier to only ingest new *_delta.json files – backlog issue fixed.
* Added human-friendly logging for LLM scoring & curator steps.
* Promoted **ai_engine_v3** to active pipeline; marked **ai_engine_v2** as legacy via README_LEGACY.
* Implemented state file bootstrap so first-run skips historical data.
* Fixed qualifier→processor schema mismatch; pipeline now processes and publishes new articles end-to-end.
* Added environment overrides (BF_MIN_RULE_SCORE, BF_DAILY_CAP) for rapid QA.
* Introduced local preview flag (`--serve`) that spins up http.server (port 8010-8020).
* Wrote dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`v3-ci`) that lint/tests v3 only and runs a smoke pipeline.
* Ported essential unit tests to `tests/ai_engine_v3`; updated pytest config to ignore v2.

## Pain points / issues encountered

* Historical raw_scrape archives caused >10 k articles in first run.
* Pydantic validation errors due to missing/extra fields when converting curator output.
* Daily cap reached prevented second batch from publishing; clarified workflow.
* Apple-touch icon 404s when serving locally (cosmetic).

## Task tracker

| Task | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Rename/ create branch `ai-engine-v3-main` and set as default | Finalise project structure | ⬜️ Todo |
| Move v2 code under `legacy/` or tag v2.99 | prevent accidental edits | ⬜️ Todo |
| Update Netlify / production deploy scripts to pull v3 website directory | seamless prod rollout | ⬜️ Todo |
| Add cron/scheduler entry for fetch+qualify v3 | unattended runs | ⬜️ Todo |
| Expand v3 test coverage (scraper, curator, storage) | confidence | ⬜️ Todo |
| Wire cost-tracking metrics into CI artifact | budget monitoring | ⬜️ Todo |
| Clean up 404 icons & add favicon to website root | polish local preview | ⬜️ Todo |
| Update docs (README, ROADMAP) to reference v3 | developer onboarding | ⬜️ Todo |

## Action items for tomorrow

1. Create `ai-engine-v3-main` branch, push, open PR → set default.
2. Move `ai_engine_v2` directory into `legacy/` and adjust import paths only inside v2 tests (skip in pytest).
3. Add GitHub Action for nightly scheduled v3 pipeline run with dry-run mode.
4. Prepare Netlify preview branch pointing at `ai_engine_v3/website`.
5. Draft documentation updates.
