# Daily Engineering Log ‚Äì 2025-06-28

## What we accomplished today

* Removed all obsolete v2 workflow files and deleted their branches on GitHub.
* Protected snapshot branch `v3-stable-20250627` (no force-push or deletion).
* Created new dev branch `ai-engine-v4-main` from v3 head.
* Copied website to `ai_engine_v4/website` and added workflow `deploy-pages-v4.yml` ‚áí preview site at `/v4-site/` now live.
* Drafted high-tier review prompt for 100 % contextual-word coverage.
* Added `ai_engine_v4` package with new models, storage, client and prompt loader.
* Implemented `prompts/review_tooltips.jinja` and `scripts/verify_news.py`; high-tier verifier logic now in place.
* Added packaging metadata (`pyproject.toml`) for `ai_engine_v4` to enable editable install in CI.
* Fixed ModuleNotFoundError for verifier by exporting PYTHONPATH in workflow.
* Limit v4 verifier to new batch by clearing pending store each run.
* Trim pending store to today only in workflow to cap verifier volume.
* Cap verifier to newest 10 articles to control spend.

## Major Debugging Session - V4 Pipeline Issues

### ‚úÖ Critical V4 Pipeline Fixes
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Discovered V3 and V4 workflows were deploying to same location, causing identical content
- **Deployment Separation**: Correctly configured V3 ‚Üí root site, V4 ‚Üí /v4-site/ 
- **Article Limitation Removed**: Fixed V4 artificial cap of 10 articles - now processes ALL articles like V3
- **Aggressive Cache-Busting**: Implemented auto-cache-busting to eliminate manual browser cache clearing

### üîß Technical Implementations
1. **Fixed Deployment Conflicts**:
   - V3 workflow: deploys `ai_engine_v3/website` ‚Üí root site (basic articles)
   - V4 workflow: deploys `ai_engine_v4/website` ‚Üí `/v4-site/` (enhanced articles)
   - Removed V4 root site deployment that was overwriting V3

2. **Removed V4 Artificial Limitations**:
   - Deleted "Trim to today only" step
   - Deleted "Cap to newest 10" step  
   - V4 now processes ALL articles from V3 (200+), not just 10

3. **Aggressive Cache-Busting System**:
   - Created `scripts/auto_cache_bust.py` for automatic timestamp updates
   - Added comprehensive no-cache headers to HTML
   - Enhanced JavaScript fetch with multiple cache-busting parameters
   - Integrated into V4 workflow for automatic deployment

### üéØ Verification Results
- **V4 Data Analysis**: Confirmed 10 articles were successfully verified with `quality_checked: true`
- **Enhancement Examples**: Hugo Flayac surname with cultural context, d√©partement explanations
- **Quality Metrics**: 45.6% cultural context coverage, 100% detailed explanations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Resolved
1. **Root Cause**: Both V3/V4 deploying to same gh-pages location
2. **User Confusion**: V4 showing identical content to V3 due to deployment conflicts
3. **Design Flaw**: V4 artificially limited to 10 articles instead of enhancing all V3 content
4. **Cache Problems**: Users having to manually clear browser cache

## Pain points / issues encountered

* Some legacy branches pointed to nowhere ‚Äì had to prune them locally and remotely.
* GitHub UI still shows old workflow runs; harmless but noisy.
* Initial confusion about V4 article limitations (resolved)
* Deployment conflict discovery took time (resolved)
* Terminal getting stuck on complex echo commands (worked around)

## Lessons Learned
- Always verify deployment destinations when running parallel workflows
- User expectations should drive design decisions (V4 = enhanced V3, not subset)
- Comprehensive cache-busting requires multiple layers (headers + timestamps + fetch params)
- Document debugging sessions as thoroughly as initial implementation work
