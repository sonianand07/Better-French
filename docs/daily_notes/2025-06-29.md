## Session Summary
Fixed critical issue where V3 website wasn't updating despite successful article processing.

## Accomplishments ✅
1. **Identified V3 Deployment Issue**
   - V4 workflow was processing V3 articles but only deploying V4 site
   - Root site (V3) was never getting deployed
   
2. **Fixed V4 Workflow**
   - Added V3 deployment step to deploy-pages-v4.yml
   - Now deploys both V3 (root) and V4 (/v4-site/) when run
   - Used `keep_files: true` to preserve v4-site subdirectory

## Pain Points 😤
1. **Confusing Workflow Dependencies**
   - V4 workflow runs V3's processing but wasn't deploying V3's site
   - This created a situation where articles were processed but not visible

## Next Actions 🚀
1. Run the updated V4 workflow to deploy both sites
2. Consider renaming workflows for clarity
3. Add monitoring to ensure both sites update

## File Change Log 📝
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages-v4.yml` - Added V3 deployment step, renamed workflow

## Technical Details 🔧
The issue occurred because:
- V3 workflow is disabled (schedule commented out)
- V4 workflow processes V3 articles but only deployed to /v4-site/
- Solution: V4 workflow now deploys to both locations
