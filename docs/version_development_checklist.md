# AI Engine Version Development Checklist

## **Purpose**
This checklist ensures NO CRITICAL ISSUES are missed when developing new AI Engine versions. Created after V5 development revealed multiple oversights that required manual discovery.

**Rule: Check EVERY item before claiming a version is "ready"**

### **Core System Design**
- [ ] **Architecture document created** (`ARCHITECTURE_README.md`)
- [ ] **Problem statement defined** (What does this version solve?)
- [ ] **Quality preservation verified** (No reduction from previous version)
- [ ] **Backward compatibility planned** (Data, APIs, workflows)
- [ ] **Deployment strategy defined** (Separate sites, directories, domains)
- [ ] **Rollback plan documented** (How to revert if issues found)

### **Data Flow Design**
- [ ] **Input sources identified** (31 RSS feeds, data files, APIs)
- [ ] **Processing pipeline mapped** (Each step documented)
- [ ] **Output formats specified** (JSON schemas, HTML structures)
- [ ] **Error handling designed** (Fallbacks, retries, graceful degradation)

## **üìù VERSION-SPECIFIC NOTES**

### **V5 Lessons Learned**
1. **Quality degradation through generic LLM prompts** - Always preserve proven keyword-based systems
2. **Import path failures in CI** - Use robust import patterns with fallbacks
3. **Missing dependencies** - Install ALL required packages, not just main requirements
4. **API key security issues** - Use separate keys for different purposes
5. **Silent failures** - Implement comprehensive error detection and reporting

### **V6 Considerations** (Future)
- [ ] **Multi-language support** (Extend beyond French)
- [ ] **User personalization** (Individual user profiles and preferences)
- [ ] **Real-time processing** (Live article updates without batch processing)
- [ ] **Advanced analytics** (User engagement tracking and optimization)
- [ ] **Mobile app integration** (API endpoints for mobile applications)
