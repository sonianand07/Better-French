### Detailed briefs

#### F-001 MCP server v2 ‚Äì live-site health & advice
**WHAT**  
A standalone micro-service (Modal-Context Protocol) that continuously pulls the production `rolling_articles.json`, validates it against the latest Pydantic schema and serves three endpoints:  
‚Ä¢ `/status` ‚Äì current health metrics<br/>‚Ä¢ `/advice` ‚Äì actionable remediation tips<br/>‚Ä¢ `/chat` ‚Äì Q&A over the dataset & metrics

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Eliminates blind spots when the public feed goes stale or malformed.  
‚Ä¢ Enables user-friendly status banners on the website and Slack/Email alerts.  
‚Ä¢ Forms the foundation for future admin dashboards.

**HOW**  
1. FastAPI + Pydantic v2, packaged in Docker; deploy to Fly.io.  
2. APScheduler job every 5 min fetches Netlify URL, computes metrics, stores SQLite/Redis cache.  
3. Reuse validation rules in `ai_engine_v3/validator.py`.  
4. GitHub Action contract test hits preview URLs.  
5. SLA: < 200 ms P95 latency, 99.9 % uptime.

#### F-002 One-click feedback loop for tool-tips
**WHAT**  
In-page editor lets approved translators fix vocabulary/tool-tip text; patches stored in `config/manual_overrides.json` and injected by the processor.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Crowdsources linguistic accuracy.  
‚Ä¢ Converts multi-step PR workflow into a few seconds.

**HOW**  
Front-end pencil icon ‚Üí POST `/api/override` (Netlify Function) ‚Üí commit override ‚Üí pipeline re-runs.  
Secure with Netlify Identity. Unit tests with Cypress.

#### F-003 Playwright UI checker bot
**WHAT**  
Headless tests that take Percy snapshots & run Axe accessibility audits on each PR.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Catches visual or WCAG regressions early.

**HOW**  
GitHub Action with Playwright matrix (Chrome/dark-mode). Thresholds: visual diff < 0.1 %, 0 new Axe critical issues. Update-snapshot workflow for intentional design changes.

#### F-004 Supabase raw-archive storage
**WHAT**  
Uploads hourly raw scraped deltas to Supabase object storage; keep only last 30 days locally.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Prevents repo/CI bloat.  
‚Ä¢ Enables SQL-style analytics.

**HOW**  
Create bucket `raw_archive`; signed URLs (7 days). Extend `fetch_news.py` to `supabase.upload()`. Cleanup job prunes local files older > 30 days. Backfill script available.

#### F-005 Audio TTS (ElevenLabs)
**WHAT**  
Generates French MP3 per article, adds `audio_url` to JSON and play-button on site.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Multi-modal learning boosts comprehension.  

**HOW**  
`processor.generate_tts()` with hash-cache. Respect daily credit cap via env var. Lazy-load `<audio>` on click.

#### F-006 Personalised ranking
**WHAT**  
Ranks feed per user profile via LightGBM/implicit-ALS model served by `personaliser.py`.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Higher engagement; groundwork for premium adaptive curriculum.

**HOW**  
Nightly trainer writes `model.bin`. FastAPI endpoint `POST /rank` returns ordered list. A/B test vs control; metrics: dwell-time lift.

#### F-007 UI filters
**WHAT**  
Difficulty dropdown, tone chips, tag cloud filter client-side.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Reduces cognitive overload, improves focus.

**HOW**  
Expose `difficulty`, `tone`, `tags` in JSON. Svelte store filters reactively; persist to `localStorage`. QA test ensures filter correctness.

#### F-008 Backup pruning
**WHAT**  
Keeps only newest 200 `rolling_*.json` backups.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Avoids thousands of files slowing Netlify uploads.

**HOW**  
Hourly CI step: `ls -1t backups/rolling_*.json | tail -n +201 | xargs rm`. Dry-run in dev.

#### F-009 Lighthouse performance budget
**WHAT**  
Lighthouse-CI in GitHub Actions that fails PRs when core web vitals drop below budget.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Guarantees snappy UX on low-end devices.

**HOW**  
Add `treosh/lighthouse-ci-action`; budgets in `qa/`. Report trends on GitHub Pages; "override" label to bypass temporarily.

#### F-010 Context block for contextual words ‚Äì richer LLM input
**WHAT**  
Generate a concise context block (~120-200 tokens) per article (summary + key facts) and pass it alongside the headline to the contextual-words prompt.

**WHY**  
‚Ä¢ Gives the LLM enough background to disambiguate names, idioms and metaphors without the cost of full-article input.  
‚Ä¢ Expected to reduce vague placeholders and improve gloss accuracy.

**HOW**  
1. Add `context_block: str` field to `Article` model.  
2. New pipeline stage: LLM summariser (‚â§80 words, must mention main entities).  
3. Run spaCy NER on article to extract top PERSON/ORG/DATE/NUM tokens ‚Üí bullet list under "Key facts".  
4. Cache the combined block and include it in the contextual-words Jinja prompt (`{{ context_block }}`).  
5. Extend validator: any entity in Key facts must appear in `original_word` list; reject otherwise.  
6. Unit tests + QA smoke update.
