Better French App – Business & Product Strategy

Analysis

## 1. Market Opportunity Analysis

Large and Growing Non-Native Population: France is home to a substantial and rising population of

non-native residents who need to learn French. As of 2023, about 7.3 million immigrants live in France

(10.7%  of  the  population).  This  includes  students,  foreign  workers,  family  migrants,  and  refugees.

Crucially, recent immigration is at record highs: in 2023 France issued 320,000+ new residence permits

to  non-EU  foreigners,  up  1.4%  from  the  prior  year

1

2

.  Of  these, over  100,000 were  for

international students, 91,000 for  family  reunification, ~54,000 for  economic/work  migrants,  and

~48,000 for  refugees  or  similar  humanitarian  statuses

3

4

.  This  confirms  the  significant  annual

inflow  of  non-natives  who  likely  need  French  language  support.  Many  of  these  categories  are  also

cumulative: for example, France now hosts 430,000 foreign students in higher education (2023/24)

5

and an estimated 1.5 million+ foreign EU citizens active in the labor market (out of ~2.4 million EU-

born residents) according to INSEE data. In addition, hundreds of thousands of non-EU immigrants

reside in France for work or family reasons, and tens of thousands of new refugees are accepted each

year

3

. Overall, the current addressable market in France is on the order of a few million non-native

adults who need to improve their French proficiency for daily life.

Future Growth Trends: This market is set to grow further. The French government’s strategy aims for

500,000 international students by 2027 (up from 430k now)

6

, and immigration flows remain high

post-Covid  (2022  even  saw  ~490k  new  arrivals)

7

.  France’s  demographic  and  labor  needs  suggest

continued recruitment of foreign talent, and geopolitical events (e.g. conflicts) drive refugee inflows.

Meanwhile, the government’s statistics show family and student migration remain robust despite policy

debates

3

. In sum, the total addressable market of non-native French residents will likely expand in

coming years, ensuring a growing pool of potential users for Better French.

Active Language Learners Subset: Among these millions of non-natives, a large subset actively seek to

improve their French. For instance, newly arrived immigrants often enroll in integration and language

courses. In 2024, 114,443 new immigrants signed the Contrat d’Intégration Républicaine (CIR) – the

government’s integration contract – which includes French language training

8

. On average, ~106,500

immigrants per year have been signing the CIR since 2018

8

, indicating a significant annual cohort

receiving formal French lessons. Notably, 45.8% of CIR participants in 2023 had below A1 French

level and required up to 600 hours of language classes

9

. This underscores that tens of thousands

of newcomers arrive with minimal French and are actively studying. Beyond government programs,

many others pursue learning through private courses, apps, or self-study: international students (430k

in France) often take French as a foreign language if their programs are in English, and working expats

frequently attempt to improve language skills to advance their careers. Even long-term immigrants

continue to seek better French for naturalization exams or job opportunities. Although exact numbers

are hard to pin down, it’s reasonable to estimate hundreds of thousands of non-native residents in

France are actively trying to improve their French at any given time.

Pain Points & Unmet Needs: Research and surveys reveal key pain points for these learners, which

### Better French can address:

•

Language Barrier to Integration: Lack of French proficiency is a well-documented barrier to

employment, education, and social integration. Migrants who do not speak French “struggle to

integrate” and face limited opportunities, according to analyses of migrant challenges

10

11

.

Difficulty understanding local news and bureaucracy leaves many feeling isolated. A targeted

solution that helps them comprehend daily French information (like news) fills an important gap

in the integration process.

•

Complexity of Native Media: Authentic French news is often too difficult for learners due to fast

speech, idiomatic language, and assumed cultural knowledge. A recent study on “Easy French”

content  showed  that simplified  news  texts  dramatically  improve  comprehension for

migrants with low literacy: in a test, 87 migrants answered significantly more questions correctly

after reading rewritten, simplified articles versus the original versions

12

. This evidence confirms

the need for contextualized, simplified news: learners benefit when vocabulary and grammar are

adjusted  to  their  level.  Standard  news  (e.g. Le  Monde or  TV  news)  is  overwhelming  for

intermediate learners, so many avoid French media altogether, missing out on both language

practice and current events.

•

Lack of Engaging Content: Traditional language classes and apps often use artificial sentences

or academic texts that learners find boring or irrelevant. Many immigrants report that courses

focus on grammar drills but leave them unable to handle real-world conversations

13

. There is a

demand for real, interesting content (like news, pop culture, etc.) presented in an accessible way.

This aligns with language acquisition research emphasizing comprehensible input – material that

is interesting, contextual, and just beyond the learner’s current level

14

15

. By using daily news

stories  (which  are  inherently  dynamic  and  relevant),  Better  French  can  provide  compelling

content that motivates learners to read consistently.

•

Cost and Accessibility: Another pain point is the cost or scarcity of good language resources.

Globally, 53% of people cite the difficulty of French and 29% cite the cost of lessons as

major obstacles to learning the language

16

. Many immigrants may not afford private tutors

or extensive classes. Free options (like community classes or online materials) can be limited or

of variable quality. Better French’s model – a web app accessible from anywhere, potentially

freemium  –  can  alleviate  these  issues  by  providing  affordable,  self-paced  practice.  It  meets

learners  where  they  are,  including  those  who  cannot  attend  regular  classes  (e.g.  a  working

parent or someone in a rural area).

•

Understanding French Society: Non-native residents often want not just language skills but

also cultural literacy – essentially, to “learn the language in order to understand the country.”

Consuming news in simplified French hits both goals. As one language publication noted, using

news media as a learning tool is a gateway to understanding French society in context

15

. This dual

benefit (language + cultural insight) is a strong selling point. For immigrants, being able to follow

what’s happening in France – elections, strikes, local COVID rules, etc. – is invaluable for feeling

included. Existing solutions like generic language apps don’t offer this contextual learning.

In summary, the market analysis validates a substantial and growing audience for Better French.

Millions of non-native French residents need help improving their language, and a large subset are

actively seeking solutions. Key pain points –  difficult  native  content,  lack of  engaging practice,  cost

barriers, and desire for cultural context – remain only partially solved by current offerings. A product

that curates simplified news with translations and notes directly addresses these pains. It can help users

2


overcome the comprehension gap identified in studies (improving their success rate on understanding

news

12

), reduce integration inequalities stemming from language

10

, and surmount the motivational

and cost issues by providing an engaging, possibly low-cost learning tool. The strong underlying need

and up-to-date data on market size give confidence in the business opportunity for Better French.

## 2. Target User Personas

Better French’s target users can be categorized into several personas, each with distinct needs and

behaviors.  These  personas  are  derived  from  the  founder’s  internal  profiles  (students,  workers,  etc.)

expanded  with  external  research  (e.g.  au  pairs,  refugees,  digital  nomads).  Below  we  define  each

persona and then compare their needs in a summary table.

•

International  Student  (University  Level): Often  an  exchange  or  degree  student

(undergraduate or graduate) from abroad, age ~18–25. They may speak some French (especially

if from Francophone Africa or having studied French in their home country) but many are far

from fluent. Their primary needs are to succeed academically (if courses are in French or they

need  to  interact  with  professors),  integrate  socially  with  French  peers,  and  handle  daily  life

(housing, banking) independently. They want to expand vocabulary and cultural knowledge so

they can converse beyond classroom topics. Their content interests skew towards practical and

cultural news: e.g. local events, student life in France, pop culture, as well as major national

news that everyone on campus talks about. Pricing sensitivity is high, given student budgets –

many will gravitate to free resources or modest subscription fees (a few euros per month). This

persona  is  also digitally  native:  they  prefer mobile  platforms,  consuming  content  on  their

smartphones during commutes or breaks. (They might also use a laptop for study, but mobile

accessibility is key for informal learning.)

•

Young Professional Expat (Foreign Worker): This persona covers both Non-EU skilled workers

(e.g. an Indian IT engineer, American startup employee) and EU mobile workers (e.g. a Spanish

nurse,  Italian  marketing  professional)  living  in  France.  Ages  range  ~25–45.  Their  French

proficiency varies – some studied basics before moving, others arrive with near zero French – but

all realize they need better language skills to advance in the workplace and integrate. Needs:

They  must  improve  French  for professional  success (participating  in  meetings,  networking,

maybe passing a language exam for residency) and for daily convenience (understanding news,

communicating  with  colleagues  or  neighbors).  They  value  content  related  to business,

economy, and daily news (so they can discuss current events at work or understand policies

that  affect  their  job  or  visa  status).  They  may  also  be  interested  in  news  about housing,

transportation,  or  family  life in  France  if  they  are  settling  long-term.  Pricing  sensitivity  is

medium – as employed adults, they can pay for a quality product that clearly helps their career,

but they will expect tangible value. (Employers might even reimburse language training, but an

affordable app is still attractive compared to costly classes.) Platform preference is mixed: many

use a computer at work (so a web app for lunchtime reading could work), but they also use

smartphones  heavily  (especially  during  commutes  or  business  travel).  Push  notifications  on

mobile (for a daily news lesson) could engage them without disrupting work.

•

Family Migrant / Spouse: This persona is someone who moved to France for family reasons –

e.g. joining a French spouse or as part of family reunification. Often age 25–40, could be male or

female, and from diverse regions (North Africa, Asia, other parts of Europe, etc.). They might not

have strong French on arrival, especially if coming from a country where French isn’t spoken.

Their needs center on integration into the community: communicating with their spouse’s

family, handling children’s schooling (if they have kids), navigating healthcare and services – all

3


of which require French. Many in this group aim for long-term residency or citizenship, meaning

they  eventually  need  to  pass  a  French  language  exam  at  B1  level.  They  are  interested  in

practical and local news: community news, parenting and education news, cultural norms, as

well  as  general  national  news  (to  understand  what  their  French  family  discusses).  Pricing

sensitivity can be moderate to high. If the person is not working and reliant on their spouse,

they may have a limited personal budget for apps; however, the household might invest in their

learning since it’s important for the whole family’s integration. This persona might appreciate a

web interface (perhaps studying at home on a laptop while kids are at school), but also mobile

for convenience (e.g. reading an article on their phone while waiting at the school pickup). They

may not be as tech-savvy as younger students, so the UX should be simple and could consider

slightly  larger  text  or  a  tablet-friendly  design  (many  stay-at-home  parents  use  tablets  for  e-

reading, for example).

•

Refugee  /  Humanitarian  Migrant: Individuals  who  arrived  in  France  under  asylum  or

humanitarian programs, often escaping conflict. They can be very diverse in age and education,

but many are adults ~20–50 who did not speak French before. This persona usually goes through

government-funded  language  courses  initially,  but  those  courses  may  be  insufficient  for

reaching  news-comprehension  level.  Their primary  need is basic  to  intermediate  French

proficiency to rebuild their lives – finding jobs, understanding official information (law, rights,

healthcare), and connecting with the host society. They would benefit greatly from accessible

news about civic life, rights, and everyday culture, since understanding news helps them feel a

sense of belonging and know what is happening in their new home. Content interests might

include simplified news about government policies (especially those affecting immigrants), local

city news (public transport changes, etc.), and also world news (including about their region of

origin, presented in French for practice). Pricing sensitivity here is very high. Refugees often

have  precarious  finances;  they  likely  cannot  afford  paid  subscriptions.  They  would  seek  free

content  or  perhaps  NGO-sponsored  access.  (Better  French  might  explore  partnerships  with

nonprofits to sponsor refugee access.) Platform-wise, interestingly smartphone usage is very

prevalent in this group – studies show ~68% of urban refugees have an Internet-capable phone

17

, and smartphones are described as “indispensable tools” for migrants

18

. Thus, a mobile-

first approach is crucial for this persona. They may not own laptops, so ensuring the web app

works well on low-end Android phones and with limited data connectivity is important (e.g. light

pages, offline mode for downloaded articles, etc.).

•

Au Pair / Exchange Tutor: Typically a young adult (18–27) from abroad living with a French host

family to provide childcare or language tutoring, for a stay of 6–12 months. Needs: Au pairs

usually  enroll  in  a  French  course  as  part  of  their  program  and  are  keen  to improve

conversational  French  quickly –  both  to  communicate  with  the  children  and  family  and  to

socialize with peers. They often form a social circle of other au pairs or locals, so they want to

pick  up  slang,  cultural  references,  and  everyday  news  topics  (so  they  aren’t  lost  in  group

### conversations).   Content   interests   would   lean   towards  light   news   and   cultural   stories:

entertainment, lifestyle, city events, maybe youth-oriented political news (e.g. climate protests,

viral stories in France). Pricing sensitivity is very high – au pairs earn a small stipend. Many look

for free resources or those under ~€5/month. Perhaps host families might pay for a learning app

as part of their stipend perks, but generally cost is a concern. Au pairs are heavy smartphone

users (Instagram, TikTok, etc. in their downtime), so mobile app access is key. They likely won’t

use a desktop except maybe the host family’s shared computer occasionally, so reaching them

means being on their phone. Quick, engaging content (with maybe a fun tone) will appeal to

them.

4


•

Digital Nomad / Remote Worker in France: An emerging persona – foreigners who choose to

live in France for a period while working remotely (often on tourist or freelance visas). They

might be 25–40, tech-savvy and cosmopolitan. They often speak English for work and might get

by in France with English in urban centers, but learning French enriches their experience and

helps in daily tasks. Their needs are somewhat less urgent (since their job doesn’t depend on

French), but they desire conversational ability and cultural immersion. Content interests: a

broad mix – trending national news (so they can discuss it at co-working spaces or with local

friends),  travel  and  culture  news  (since  they  may  explore  France  extensively),  and  perhaps

business/startup news if they are in those circles. Pricing sensitivity is medium-low – digital

nomads often have decent income in foreign currency; they invest in self-improvement tools.

They likely won’t mind paying for a quality app that adds value to their travel experience. This

persona uses both web and mobile: they work on laptops, so a web app could be used during a

lunch break to read an article. But they also are on the move, so they’d use the mobile app on

trains/planes or in cafes. Supporting both platforms eventually will be important to fully capture

this segment’s usage patterns.

Below is a comparative summary of these personas, highlighting their needs, content preferences, pricing sensitivity, and platform usage:

| User Persona | Key Needs & Goals | Content Interests | Pricing Sensitivity | Preferred Platforms |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **International Student** | Integrate on campus; pass courses; make French friends; improve everyday vocabulary for social and academic life. | Campus life news, youth culture, national news explained simply (to discuss with peers), trending memes/events. | **High** – Student budget, seeks free or low‑cost options. | **Mobile‑first** – constant smartphone use; also uses laptop for study (web app useful). |
| **Young Professional Expat**<br/>(Worker, EU or non‑EU) | Advance career (learn professional French); navigate daily admin (housing, banking); connect with colleagues socially. | Business/economic news, tech and industry news, major national news, practical info (e.g. labor law changes, transport strikes). | **Medium** – Will pay if it clearly helps career; expects value for money. | **Both Web & Mobile** – web at work PC during breaks; mobile during commute and off‑hours. |
| **Family Migrant / Spouse** | Integrate into local community; manage family needs (school, services); prepare for residency/citizenship language requirements. | Local news, family/education news, cultural explainers (holidays, norms), “news of the day” to discuss with French spouse/family. | **Moderate–High** – May have limited personal income; cost often needs justification within household. | **Mixed** – uses web/tablet at home (e.g. after chores) for studying; mobile for on‑the‑go reading. |
| **Refugee / Humanitarian** | Achieve basic French for survival and job; understand host country’s society and laws; build confidence in reading. | Simplified civic news (government, rights, community updates), major world news in easy French (including about their home region), practical info (health, transportation). | **Very High** – Relies on free access (NGO programs or free app tier); unlikely to afford paid plans individually. | **Mobile‑focused** – Smartphone is primary device (often only device); needs offline‑friendly mobile app. |
| **Au Pair** | Learn conversational French fast; engage with host family and kids; make local friends; perhaps prepare for future studies. | Entertainment and pop‑culture news, simple local news, trending social media topics in France, youth‑oriented stories (music, sports). | **Very High** – Minimal disposable income; prefers free content or <€5/month if any. | **Mobile‑only** – always on smartphone (TikTok, IG); expects bite‑sized mobile content. |
| **Digital Nomad / Remote Worker** | Enrich living‑abroad experience; handle daily interactions; gain cultural insight while working remotely. | General French news (politics, society) for cultural immersion, travel & lifestyle news, entrepreneurship/startup news if in relevant scene. | **Low–Medium** – Willing to invest in self‑improvement; cost not a big barrier if product is high‑quality. | **Both – Web & Mobile** – Web (laptop) while working, plus Mobile when exploring or during travel. |

## 3. Revenue Model Benchmarking

Achieving a sustainable revenue model is crucial for Better French. We examine how similar language-

learning apps monetize and draw lessons to inform Better French’s strategy. Key models in the industry

include freemium  subscriptions,  paid  premium  content,  and  advertising,  often  in  combination.

### Below we benchmark notable players and relevant metrics:

•

Duolingo (Freemium + Ads + Subscription): Duolingo is a benchmark for freemium success. It

acquired  hundreds  of  millions  of  users  by  offering  a  fully  free,  gamified  language  app,

monetizing via ads and an optional paid tier (“Duolingo Plus/Super” for removing ads and extra

features). As of 2024, Duolingo had ~73 million monthly active users and ~9.5 million paid

subscribers

19

20

– roughly 8.6% of users opt for the paid plan

21

. Notably, that ~8–9% of

paying users contributed about 80% of Duolingo’s $531M revenue in 2023, with ads on the 90%

+ free users making up only ~20%

21

. This underscores a key point: at scale, subscriptions yield

far higher ARPU (average revenue per user) than ads. Duolingo’s ad-supported free tier earns

only  a  few  dollars  per  user  annually  by  estimates,  whereas  a  subscriber  is  worth  ~$80/year.

Duolingo’s strategy shows the freemium funnel in action: attract a massive user base with free

content, then convert a fraction to paid. However, it also highlights that one needs either huge

scale for an ad-supported model to be lucrative, or a strategy to convert a healthy percentage to

subscriptions.  Duolingo  uses  heavy  gamification,  streaks,  and  now  AI  features  to  boost

engagement and upsell users to Plus. The lesson for Better French is that a free tier can drive

user acquisition, but real revenue likely depends on converting engaged learners to a paid plan

(given Better French will start with a niche audience, not hundreds of millions). Also, Duolingo

demonstrates  that  ads  alone  yield  low  revenue  per  user  –  useful  to  have  as  supplemental

income, but not sufficient for a small startup without scale.

•

Babbel (Paid Subscription, No Free Course): Babbel takes the opposite approach – essentially

100% subscription model (aside from a brief trial lesson). Users must pay to access Babbel’s full

courses. This yields a higher upfront conversion of those who try it, but it limits the top-of-funnel

user base (no large free community like Duolingo’s). Babbel’s revenue (~€200M range in recent

years) is smaller than Duolingo’s, but its revenue per user is higher. Babbel reportedly has a few

million active subscribers globally. The implication is that a premium-content model can work if

users perceive high value and if marketing can directly acquire paying customers. However, it

may be challenging for a new app like Better French to convince users to subscribe without

letting  them  experience  the  value  first.  Babbel’s  strategy  suggests  focusing  on efficacy  and

targeted marketing (they emphasize being “fast & effective” for serious learners).

•

Newsdle (Subscription for Niche News-Based Learning): Newsdle is a close analog to Better

French,  offering  graded  news  articles  for  French  (and  Spanish)  learners.  Newsdle  uses  a

subscription paywall model after a trial. Its pricing is around $10 per month, with discounts for

longer plans (e.g. $80/year)

22

23

. Essentially, it monetizes like a digital magazine or e-learning

platform.  According  to  reviews,  Newsdle  provides  3  new  lessons  daily  and  has  rich  features

(vocab flashcards, audio, quizzes), justifying the fee

24

25

. This demonstrates that learners will

pay for specialized content if it’s perceived as unique and high-quality. A third-party analysis

notes Newsdle’s model is “straightforward $10/month” and ideal for learners who enjoy staying

informed

26

25

. There is no ad-supported free tier mentioned – you pay for access. For Better

7


French, which targets a similar value proposition (learning through news), Newsdle’s success (the

exact user numbers are not public) indicates a premium niche strategy can work if the content

is compelling enough. However, to draw users in, offering a free sample or freemium element

could reduce friction; Newsdle itself likely offers a limited free trial or a few free articles to entice

sign-ups. Price-wise, $10/month (~€9) seems to be a standard for this type of service, and Better

French’s pricing could align in that range for a full subscription.

•

LingQ (Freemium with Usage Limits): LingQ is a platform that lets users read and listen to

content (including news and novels) in various languages with instant dictionary lookup. LingQ’s

model is freemium: free users can use the system but with limits (e.g. only create a limited

number of “LingQs” – saved words). To get unlimited functionality, users subscribe (around $12/

month). LingQ also offers lifetime membership options. The conversion rate isn’t published, but

community  comments  suggest  that  because  the  free  version  is  quite  limited,  “most  serious

learners have a subscription”

27

. This indicates that a strategically constrained free tier can

push  power-users  to  pay,  while  still  allowing  curious  new  users  to  try  the  service.  LingQ’s

approach might inspire Better French to have a free tier with limits – for example, allow a

certain  number  of  free  articles  or  translations  per  month,  then  require  a  subscription  for

unlimited access. This way, the product can market itself (users get a taste of how it works) but

still  monetize  heavy  users.  LingQ  also  shows  the  potential  of lifetime  plans  or  one-time

purchases for committed learners – something Better French could consider (though those are

essentially prepaid subscriptions with a different framing).

•

Advertising Revenue Benchmarks: Many language platforms use ads to monetize free users,

but  it’s  widely  acknowledged  that  ad  revenue  per  user  is  relatively  low  unless  you  have

enormous engagement. For instance, Duolingo’s ads (interstitials, banners) yield only about 20%

of their total revenue while serving tens of millions of users

21

. For a niche app like Better

French, relying on ads alone would likely not sustain the business. A rough benchmark: mobile

ad networks might pay on the order of \$0.01–\$0.02 per ad view, or a few dollars per thousand

views (CPM). If a user reads one article a day, that might be ~30 ad impressions a month –

yielding maybe \$0.05–\$0.50 monthly from that user in ad revenue. In contrast, one subscriber

might pay €5–€10 per month. This huge gap means that unless Better French expects millions of

active  users,  a  pure  ad  model  won’t  generate  enough  revenue.  Furthermore,  one  founder’s

experience in the French-learning space underscores this: the creator of “French Together” (a

blog + app) reported he stopped using Google AdSense due to low earnings, instead shifting

to  selling  his  own  courses

28

29

.  He  found  that  ads  couldn’t  compare  to  subscription  or

product sales in terms of income. This anecdote aligns with the broader trend: ads can be a

supplementary revenue stream (especially to support a free tier), but the primary model should

be something like subscriptions or content sales for meaningful revenue.

•

Conversion  Rates  &  Freemium  Performance: Industry-wide,  freemium  conversion  rates  for

consumer apps often range in the low single digits (1–5% paying). Duolingo’s ~8.6% paying is

actually quite high for a free education app

21

, likely due to their aggressive upsells and value

of offline/download features for serious users. Niche apps can see higher conversion among

active users (since those who stick around truly need the service). For example, LingQ insiders

hinted most serious readers go premium – so among active LingQ users, conversion might

27

be well above 10%, though many casual sign-ups churn out. For Better French, given the specific

pain point it solves (news comprehension), we might expect that those who genuinely use the

app  regularly  will  be  quite  likely  to  subscribe  if  they  can  afford  it,  because  the  value

(understanding daily news) is immediately clear and addictive. The challenge is persuading new

users to get to that “aha” moment. A generous trial or limited free content can help with this.

Additionally, education apps often see better conversion with tiered offerings: e.g. a basic

8


subscription vs a premium+ (Duolingo has a Super and a higher-tier Max with AI tutor). Better

French could eventually have tiers like Basic (ads + limited articles), Premium (all content ad-

free), and perhaps an add-on for personalized tutoring or live sessions (if ever considered down

the road).

•

Pricing  Levels  &  Trends: Subscription  prices  for  language  services  in  2025  typically  cluster

around $5  to  $15  per  month depending  on  the  product’s  depth.  Some  examples:  Duolingo

Super is about \$7/mo (annual plan), Babbel is ~$6–7/mo on annual plan, News in Slow French

(a specialized audio news service) charges ~$19.90/mo for full access

30

(or ~$6 for audio-only)

–  indicating  that  dedicated  content  services  can  charge  a  premium.  FrenchPod101  (podcast

lessons) offers tiers from \$4 to \$15/mo

31

. Newsdle at $10 is mid-range. We also see value

anchoring with longer commitments (annual plans 40–50% cheaper per month than monthly).

The trend is that serious learners are willing to pay around the price of a few coffees per month

for quality content, and higher prices are feasible if the content is niche and rich (e.g. News in

Slow  French’s  ~$20).  However,  pushing  above  ~$10–15  for  a  new  app  would  likely  reduce

adoption unless it offers live tutoring or extensive new content daily. Better French should likely

position its pricing in line with these benchmarks – perhaps around €8–€12 per month for full

access,  with  a  discounted  annual  option.  This  would  be  seen  as  reasonable  compared  to  a

physical  class  (which  could  be  €150+  for  a  short  course).  Also,  offering student  or  family

migrant discounts or even ad-supported free access for refugees (sponsored by CSR initiatives)

could be considered to accommodate the wide range of user budgets.

### Recommended Revenue Strategy for Better French:

Based on the above, a freemium subscription model appears best suited for Better French, balanced

with the app’s social impact goals and user ability to pay. Specifically, we suggest:

•

Freemium Structure: Implement a free tier that allows new users to experience the core value.

For example, free users can read a limited number of news articles per week (say 3 articles

weekly) with the interactive translation and notes. This provides real value up front (and taps the

integration mission – e.g. even those who can’t pay, like some refugees, still get some access to

news). Around this, include non-intrusive ads for free users (banner or occasional interstitial

after an article) to generate a bit of revenue and remind them of the premium offering. The free

tier  serves  both  marketing  (driving  word-of-mouth  and  virality)  and  the  company’s  ethos  of

helping those in need.

•

Premium  Subscription: Offer  a  paid  subscription  that  unlocks  unlimited  daily  articles,

flashcards, audio, quizzes, and an ad-free experience. This could be priced around €9.99 per

month (with perhaps €79/year option). This aligns with Newsdle’s pricing and is in the range

learners  find  acceptable

22

.  Premium  users  would  be  the  core  revenue  drivers.  Even  a  few

thousand  premium  users  can  sustain  the  app  given  low  overhead  –  for  instance, 829

subscribers were enough to generate £7.7k MRR for the French Together app (approx €9k/

mo)

32

. That case (a solo founder app hitting €100k+ annual revenue with under a thousand

subscribers)  shows  that  a  niche  language  app  can  be  financially  viable  with  a  dedicated

subscriber base. Better French can aim for similar by converting, say, 5-10% of its active user

base to premium.

•

No-Code/Partnership for Monetization Ease: Use existing payment platforms (Stripe, PayPal,

app  store  in-app  purchases)  for  subscription  management  to  minimize  dev  complexity.  Also

consider partnerships for group sales: e.g. partner with a university international office or an

NGO to buy bulk licenses for their students/clients at a discounted rate. This B2B2C approach

9


can open an additional revenue channel (selling 100 seats to an integration program at once, for

example). Some competitors do this – Newsdle markets to teachers and has a “For Teachers”

section

33

, and News in Slow French offers educational licenses. Better French could similarly

offer classroom or institutional packages (which often are priced per student but paid by the

institution).

•

Ads as Secondary Income: Keep ad monetization as a secondary stream. It can be enabled for

free users, but the UX should ensure it’s not too disruptive (perhaps just a banner or a short

sponsor message after reading an article). The goal of ads here is to offset costs of free users

and nudge them toward premium (“Remove ads and unlock unlimited articles with Premium”).

Given the relatively small user base initially, we expect ad revenue to be modest. Still, if the app

grows to tens of thousands of monthly users, even a few euros per free user per year adds up.

It’s essentially “bonus” revenue. Importantly, if pursuing ads, track metrics like eCPM and user

retention (to ensure ads aren’t driving people away).

•

Conversion Optimization: To achieve good freemium economics, Better French should employ

strategies from the benchmarks: Duolingo’s example of nudges and upsells is instructive. For

instance, after a user finishes their limited free articles, the app can show a prompt like “Enjoying

Better French? Read unlimited articles and get daily new content with Premium – start a 7-day
free trial.” A limited-time free trial for premium features can significantly improve conversion, as

users can experience the full benefit (e.g. flashcards, audio) before deciding. Another tactic is

email reminders to free users highlighting new content they’re missing or showing progress

milestones reachable with Premium (e.g. “You learned 50 new words – double that next month

with full access!”).

•

Competitive Position on Revenue: Compared to competitors, Better French will likely never

have the sheer user volume of Duolingo (given the narrower target audience), so it should not

rely on a fully free model. Instead, quality of content is its competitive advantage – akin to

Newsdle or News in Slow French, which operate sustainably on subscriptions. Better French can

differentiate by focusing on the non-native resident niche and perhaps securing goodwill via

social impact (which could later open avenues like sponsorships or grants for refugee education

technology). But from a pure business perspective, the safest path is to get paying users early

and demonstrate unit economics. Since similar products charge ~$10/month, there is proven

willingness to pay at that price for  contextual  learning content.  By  benchmarking  metrics,  if

Better French can convert even 5% of 50,000 users to a €8/month plan, that’s €20k/month – a

strong revenue for a solo/small team. In reality, conversion might concentrate among the more

motivated personas (professionals, serious students), so the key is attracting those high-value

users in the first place with targeted marketing (discussed later).

In conclusion, a hybrid freemium subscription model is recommended as the best revenue model for

Better French. It balances accessibility (important for mission and growth) with the need for sustainable

income. This model is validated by industry benchmarks: Duolingo’s freemium success (and clear data

showing paid users drive revenue)

21

, Newsdle’s direct subscription approach at a viable price point

24

, and the anecdotal evidence that relying solely on ads is insufficient

28

. Better French should start

with a free tier to build traction, then steadily optimize conversion to premium through delivering

indispensable value (helping users truly understand French news) and smart upsell strategies. As the

user base grows, the team can fine-tune the mix of free vs paid offerings (for example, introducing new

premium  features  like  live  Q&A  sessions  or  certifications  for  an  extra  fee,  if  there  is  demand).  But

initially, keeping the model simple – free basic access, paid full access – will be easiest to implement and

communicate to users.

## 4. Product Features and Roadmap

To  compete  in  the  language-learning  market  and  delight  users,  Better  French  needs  to  implement

features that address its users’ core needs (comprehending news and improving language) and keep
them engaged. We will benchmark key features from competitors and then outline a sensible MVP

feature set and development roadmap for Better French, considering the founder is a solo beginner

developer  (meaning  we  must  prioritize  ruthlessly  and  leverage  simple  solutions  or  no-code  where

possible).

### Competitor Feature Benchmarking:

•

News Curation & Level-Graded Content: This is the foundational feature of Better French –

curated French news articles adapted for learners. Competitors like Newsdle and News in Slow

French excel here. Newsdle provides an “extensive and ever-growing collection of graded news

content, categorized by level and topic,” with new lessons daily

34

. Each article in Newsdle is

labeled  (Beginner,  Intermediate,  etc.)  and  often  sorted  by  topics  (culture,  politics,  etc.),  so

learners  can  choose  appropriate  material. Leveled  content  is  a  must-have:  it  ensures

beginners aren’t overwhelmed while advanced learners stay challenged. Better French should

similarly tag or filter articles by CEFR level (e.g. A2, B1, B2). Initially, if resources are limited, even

just “Easy / Medium / Hard” labels could suffice, possibly based on vocabulary density. Over time,

an algorithm can estimate level by word frequency.

•

Clickable Translations / Live Dictionary: A core differentiator of Better French is that it will

provide instant translations of words or phrases when clicked. This feature is directly inspired

by tools like LingQ and Newsdle. In Newsdle, every news article has words that can be tapped to

get an English translation, and you can save the word to a vocab list

35

. LingQ similarly allows

clicking  any  word  to  see  translation  and  usage  examples.  This  feature  significantly  reduces

friction in reading – learners don’t have to copy-paste into Google Translate. It’s essentially the

heart of contextual learning. Benchmark: LingQ highlights new words in blue, known words in

white, and saves clicked words (yellow) for review

36

. Better French can implement a simpler

version: e.g. underline all words, and on tap, show a tooltip with translation (maybe using an API

or a built-in dictionary database). This should be in the MVP, as it’s core to the experience.

•

Vocabulary  Bank  &  Spaced  Repetition: Top  competitors  incorporate  vocabulary  review  to

reinforce learning. Newsdle has a “handy flashcard feature” where saved words go into a review

system for long-term retention

37

. It presumably uses spaced repetition (SRS) to prompt users

with flashcards at optimal intervals. Similarly, Mosalingua and Anki are known for SRS, and LingQ

tracks how many times you’ve seen a word, etc. For MVP, Better French might not build a full SRS

from  day  one,  but  at  least allowing  users  to  mark/save  words and  view  a  list  of  saved

vocabulary is important. That list can show the word, meaning, and the example sentence from

the  news  article  –  a  powerful  way  to  review  in  context.  As  a  later  feature,  a  simple  quiz  or

flashcard mode can be added. Given our solo dev scenario, using an existing flashcard library or

a no-code tool for flashcards (there are some that can import word lists) could be a shortcut. But

even without full automation, encouraging users to revisit saved words (perhaps via an email

summary or a prompt after reading X articles) adds value. Eventually, implementing a spaced

repetition  algorithm  (there  are  open-source  SRS  algorithms  that  could  be  integrated)  will

increase the app’s efficacy.

•

Grammar and Cultural Notes: Since Better French also promises grammar and cultural context,

we look at how competitors handle this. Newsdle includes “bitesize grammar lessons based on key

11


language in the article”, with points reinforced in quizzes

38

. Essentially, they take a grammatical

construct that appeared in the news story (e.g. the use of imparfait vs passé composé in that

context) and briefly explain it at the bottom of the article

38

. This is extremely relevant because

it  teaches  grammar  in  context,  which  learners  find  more  digestible.  Similarly, News  in  Slow

French often adds cultural or historical notes to news stories. Better French should incorporate

footnotes  or  side  notes in  articles  for  tricky  grammar,  idioms,  or  cultural  references.  For

example, if an article mentions “ENA” or “bac”, a cultural note can explain those terms (elite

administration school, high school exam). These notes can be manually written at first (perhaps

1–3 notes per article). They enrich the content beyond raw translation, providing deeper learning.

For  MVP,  even  one  highlighted  grammar  point  per  article  would  differentiate  the  app  and

provide talking points for marketing (“includes explanations of French idioms and grammar that

appear in the news”).

•

Audio  and  Listening  Practice: Many  learners  benefit  from  listening  to  reinforce  reading.

Competitors: Newsdle provides an integrated audio recording for each article

39

, so users

can practice listening while reading. News in Slow French is primarily an audio podcast with

transcript. LingQ also often has audio for lessons. This feature might be a stretch for an initial

version, but it’s highly recommended on the roadmap. Options: use Text-to-Speech (TTS) to

generate  fairly  natural  French  audio  for  each  article,  or  partner  with  a  service  (perhaps  the

founder or volunteers could record themselves reading some articles slowly). TTS technology is

pretty  good  now  (e.g.  Google  Cloud  TTS  or  Amazon  Polly  have  French  voices)  –  it  could  be

integrated via API to automatically produce an mp3 for each article. Offering audio would set

Better French apart as a more comprehensive tool (reading + listening). If MVP constraints don’t

allow it on day one, it should be a Stage 2 feature, added once the reading experience is stable.

Listening  helps  users  attune  to  French  pronunciation  and  is  vital  for  those  who  learned  “on

paper” only.

•

Interactive  Exercises  &  Quizzes: Gamification  and  interactivity  can  boost  engagement.

Newsdle,  for  instance,  includes  short quizzes  after  each  article  (vocab  matching,

comprehension  Qs,  fill-in-the-blank)

40

.  These  help  users  test  their  understanding  and

reinforce memory. Duolingo’s entire model is bite-sized exercises; while Better French doesn’t

need to mimic that fully, having a quick comprehension quiz (“Did you get the main idea?”) can

add  value.  For  example,  after  reading  an  article,  a  user  could  answer  2–3  multiple-choice

questions about it or do a cloze (fill the missing word from a sentence in the article). This feature

could  be  rolled  out  once  content  volume  grows  –  it  may  not  be  critical  for  MVP,  but  it’s  an

excellent engagement  feature  for  later.  Initially,  perhaps  a  single  multiple-choice  question

manually  written  per  article  is  doable.  Over  time,  the  process  can  be  semi-automated  or

community-driven (users or volunteer teachers could contribute questions).

•

Progress Tracking & Gamification: To encourage regular use, tracking progress is key. LingQ

shows  the  number  of  “known  words”  increasing,  which  is  motivating

41

.  Duolingo  uses  XP

points, streak counts, and leaderboards. For Better French, some light gamification can be very

effective given the solo dev constraint (full leaderboards might be complex, but basics are easy).

Recommended MVP tracking: show each user how many articles they’ve read this week/month,

how many words they’ve learned (e.g. number of words clicked or saved), and maintain a streak

counter for days of activity. A daily streak is a simple feature but proven to significantly boost

retention – Duolingo’s CEO often cites that as their most powerful hook. Implementing a streak

(with a reminder notification) is relatively straightforward and can be done in the web app with

local storage or via the backend. Even a basic progress bar toward a weekly goal (“Read 5 articles

this week – you’ve done 3”) can encourage usage. These gamified elements make the learning

feel like a rewarding challenge rather than a chore.

12


•

Social or Community Features: Some competitors have community forums or user-generated

content (e.g. people discussing articles, asking questions). Given Better French’s focus and dev

resources, community features might be nice-to-have later on. Initially, a full forum might be

unnecessary,  but  perhaps  a comments  section  or  Q&A  on  each  article could  add  value

(learners could ask “I didn’t get why this headline uses subjunctive – can someone explain?” and

either the staff or other users could answer). However, moderation and building a community

takes effort. This could be something to consider after establishing the core product – perhaps

partnering with existing communities (like a subreddit or Discord) rather than building inside the

app at first.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – Must-Have Features:

For the MVP, focusing on the essential user story (“I can read a French news article and understand it with

### help”) is crucial. The must-have features are:

•

Curated  Simplified  Articles: A  selection  of  French  news  articles  written  or  adapted  to  an

intermediate  level  (B1/B2  to  start,  since  A1/A2  might  require  extremely  basic  content).  Each

article should be short (perhaps 200–300 words) and interesting. For MVP, the founder might

manually simplify real news from sources like Le Monde, 20 Minutes, or use already “easy French”
sources (e.g. RFI’s Journal en français facile) and add his own spin. Even a small library of, say, 20

articles at launch is fine, as long as new ones are added regularly to retain users. The content

pipeline needs to be set up (perhaps using a no-code CMS like Contentful or even a Google Sheet

to input articles). Initially, these can be static, but eventually tagging by level/topic is needed.

•

Inline Translation Tooltips: The MVP must implement the clickable translation mechanism.

Without it, the app is just a static news reader and users would bounce to dictionaries. This could

be done via an API (e.g. Linguee or DeepL API for single words/phrases). Since the founder is a

beginner dev, a simpler approach could be pre-loading translations for difficult words in each

article (like an annotated text). However, doing it dynamically is more scalable. One no-code-ish

solution: use a JavaScript library for dictionaries. For instance, there are open-source bilingual

dictionary datasets. Another approach is to integrate a browser-based translator like the Google

Translate element, but that often translates whole pages, not ideal for word-by-word. A feasible

MVP solution: under the hood, split the article text by word, wrap each word in a span tag with a

data-translation attribute (populated by looking up that word in a dictionary database). Then on

click, show the translation. The founder might leverage an existing project or API to populate

those translations in advance (to reduce real-time API calls which can be slow). Regardless of

method, this is a core MVP feature to implement early and test with users.

•

User Account & Progress Save: While perhaps not absolutely required on day 1 (you could have

a  read-only  demo),  very  quickly  the  app  will  need  user  accounts  so  progress  (saved  words,

streaks)  can  persist.  Implementing  sign-up/login  can  be  expedited  with  tools  like  Firebase

Authentication  or  Auth0  (no  need  to  code  auth  from  scratch).  Accounts  also  enable  offering

premium  features  per  user.  The  MVP  should  allow  account  creation,  but  to  reduce  friction

consider allowing Google/Facebook single sign-on. This will make it easier for users and simpler

for the dev (offloading password management). With accounts, the app can store each user’s

saved vocab, last article read, etc.

•

Basic Vocab Save: As noted, being able to save words is important. MVP can implement a simple

icon (e.g. a star or +) on the tooltip that, when clicked, saves that word to the user’s “word list”.

The word list page can be basic: just a list of saved words with their translations, and perhaps the

13


sentence from which they were saved for context. Even without flashcard quizzing, this list is

valuable for self-review.

•

Responsive Web Design: Ensure the MVP web app is mobile-responsive. Given we might not

build  native  apps  immediately,  the  web  app  should  work  nicely  on  a  mobile  browser  (the

majority of initial users might access on their phones). This means using a clean layout, sufficient

font sizes, and touch-friendly elements. A simple design (single-column article view, translation

pop-ups) is mobile-friendly by nature. The developer can test on common screen sizes. Many

modern  web  frameworks  (React,  Vue)  have  bootstrap  or  Material  UI  components  to  ease

responsive design.

•

Stability and Content Update Process: The MVP should include a straightforward way to add

new articles frequently (since if the content is static, users will run out and leave). If the founder

can’t code a full admin portal, even using a Google Sheet or a markdown file in a GitHub repo to

add articles which then go live is fine. Possibly using a headless CMS could be a no-code solution

(there are free tiers for a few entries). The goal is to aim for maybe 3–5 new articles per week

initially (as Newsdle does daily, but for a one-person team, a few per week is a reasonable start).

Users should see content being updated to remain engaged.

### Proposed Roadmap (Stages of Development):

Keeping in mind the solo beginner developer, the roadmap should phase features so that each stage is

### functional and feedback-driven:

•

Stage 1: Core Reading Experience (MVP) – Focus: deliver the reading + translation functionality

with a small content library.

•

Develop the front-end to display articles and handle tap-to-translate. Test it with a handful of

users to ensure translations show correctly and the text is readable.

•

Set up user authentication and a simple backend or cloud database (Firebase Firestore or

similar) for storing user data (saved words, etc.). Given limited dev resources, leveraging Firebase

or Supabase can accelerate building the backend without heavy server coding.

•

Implement basic saving of words and display of saved list.

•

Establish the content creation workflow for simplified articles (the founder might do this

manually at first, which is fine).

•

Basic grammar/cultural notes can be hard-coded into the article content (e.g. footnotes) for a

few articles to test the concept.

•

No mobile app yet, but ensure mobile-web usability.

•

No-code help: At this stage, consider using a no-code website builder (like Webflow) for the

landing page and informational pages, so the dev can concentrate on the app functionality. The

app itself might need custom coding for the interactive elements, but frameworks like React or

even simpler, just jQuery on a static page, could work initially given a small scale. If coding from

scratch is daunting, a tool like Bubble.is might even be used to create a web app with logic –

though Bubble’s capability for custom text parsing might be limited. Alternatively, using

something like Notion + Potion to serve content with a glossaries might be a hacky MVP, but

likely building a custom simple app will be more flexible.

•

Timeline Stage 1: Perhaps 2–3 months, given a beginner learning as they build.

•

Stage 2: Enrichment & Engagement – Focus: add features that increase learning efficacy and

user stickiness, once the base is stable.

14


•

Audio for articles: Integrate a Text-to-Speech API or upload recorded audio for each article. This

instantly adds a listening practice dimension. Many users will love the ability to listen and read

simultaneously. Start with TTS to cover content quickly (e.g. using Google’s standard French

voice). Later, if polished content is desired, the founder could record a slower narration for some

articles or possibly involve a French tutor to record a few.

•

Flashcard/Quiz Module: Now implement a simple flashcard review for saved words. This could

be as basic as a “flip card to see translation” feature. If feasible, implement spaced repetition

scheduling – or use an existing open-source flashcard engine. (If the dev is not comfortable

coding an SRS, a quick solution: export the user’s saved words to a CSV and let them import into

Anki – but that’s not very user-friendly. Better to at least have an in-app quiz.) Perhaps show the

saved word and prompt the user to recall meaning, then show answer – logging if they got it

right/wrong and scheduling future reviews could come later.

•

Streaks and Goals: Add the streak counter and some form of progress tracking UI. For example,

show “Day X of your streak” on the dashboard. Also consider adding a weekly goal (e.g. “Set a

goal: read 5 articles this week” and track progress). This can re-engage users each week.

•

More grammar/culture notes: Start scaling up the value-add content in each article. Perhaps

by Stage 2, the founder can template a “Did you notice this phrase… here’s why it’s used” note for

each article. This might require more French linguistics knowledge but even small insights

delight users (e.g. pointing out a subjunctive mood use or a cultural reference like “the Hexagon”

meaning France).

•

UI/UX improvements: Based on early user feedback, refine the interface. Maybe introduce a

dark mode (for those reading at night), or adjust font sizes. Ensure the layout can handle longer

articles or different content types (maybe an article with dialogue, etc.).

•

Possibly invite some beta users more formally in this stage (for example, reach out in an expat

Facebook group offering early access) to gather feedback on these new features.

•

Stage 3: Expansion & Mobile App – Focus: expand platform reach and refine monetization.

•

Mobile Apps (iOS/Android): If analytics show a large portion of users accessing via mobile web,

it’s a strong signal to invest in native apps for a better experience. At this stage, consider using a

cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter to build the app using much of the

existing code/logic from the web (the solo dev can hire a freelance for a short contract or use the

existing React web code if any, to port to mobile). Alternatively, a Progressive Web App (PWA)

can be deployed so users on Android can “Add to Home Screen” and use it like an app offline. A

PWA might be an easier intermediate step; it would allow some offline caching of articles and a

fullscreen experience without going through app stores initially.

•

Offline Mode: For mobile usage, implement an offline feature (premium feature perhaps) so

users can download, say, the latest 5 articles and the dictionary data for them to read on the

subway or with no internet. This is especially useful for students or commuters.

•

Community & Social Features: If demand exists, add a community layer – perhaps a discussion

thread under each article (so users can ask for clarifications or share thoughts in a mix of

French/English). This can increase engagement time on the app and provide a sense of

community. However, it will require moderation. Another idea is a leaderboard or achievement

badges (e.g. “Read 10 articles – you earned the Bookworm badge”). Friendly competition could

be introduced if critical mass is reached – e.g. “Top readers this month” – but that only makes

sense with a larger user base.

•

Monetization Implementation: By this stage, implement the subscription payments and

paywall. Likely, this coincides with launching on app stores (since app stores can handle in-app

subscriptions easily). On web, integrate Stripe for handling subscription checkout. Ensure that

15


premium features (unlimited content, no ads, offline access, etc.) are properly gated. Also,

possibly launch a referral program (users inviting friends get a free month, etc.) to spur growth.

•

Content Scaling: At Stage 3, consider bringing in additional content help. Perhaps partner with

a journalism student or a freelance writer who can help produce simplified news articles or

grammar notes. Alternatively, allow user-generated contributions: maybe advanced bilingual

volunteers could submit articles or translations. (Quality control is an issue, but a community

contribution model could be explored to increase content output without straining the founder.)

•

AI Assistance: As a future horizon, the app could leverage AI to assist with content creation or

personalized learning. For example, an AI chatbot that users can ask for clarification (“Explain

this sentence to me” or “Use this word in another sentence”) could be a premium tutoring

feature. Duolingo and others are moving in this direction with GPT-4. This is optional, but worth

noting as a long-term roadmap item if resources allow, since it aligns with the trend of using AI

as a virtual language tutor.

### Guidance on Tech Strategy for a Solo Developer:

Given the founder’s beginner status in coding, it’s important to leverage high-level tools and avoid

### reinventing the wheel:

•

Use frameworks and SDKs that simplify common tasks. For example, Firebase can handle user

auth,  database,  and  even  hosting,  so  the  dev  can  avoid  building  a  custom  backend  server

initially. Likewise, using a UI kit (like Bootstrap or Vuetify) can speed up frontend design.

•

Embrace no-code/low-code solutions for non-core components. For instance, the marketing

website could be built in Webflow or WordPress, instead of coding it from scratch, so the focus

stays on the app. For the app itself, some parts can be no-code: e.g. using a form builder for

feedback collection, or an analytics service for tracking usage (e.g. Google Analytics or Mixpanel)

rather than custom event logging.

•

Partnerships  or  integrations can  fill  feature  gaps.  If  developing  a  flashcard  algorithm  is

daunting, consider integrating with Quizlet’s API or AnkiConnect – or even just exporting user

vocab so they can use Quizlet/Anki (as a stop-gap). If recording audio is not feasible, use a text-

to-speech API (as mentioned) to generate it automatically. If the founder knows any French

teachers or linguists, he could form  an  advisory  circle where  they  contribute  a grammar  tip

occasionally in exchange for recognition or a small fee – essentially outsourcing the knowledge

content so he focuses on coding.

•

Scale back where needed. It’s better to launch with a few polished features than many buggy

ones. For example, if coding a discussion forum is too complex, skip it – users can be directed to

an existing subreddit or a Discord channel for community interaction initially. If building native

apps is too much at first, emphasize the web app and optimize it for mobile; many users might

be fine with that for a while.

•

Testing and feedback: A solo dev should engage early beta testers (maybe 5–10 users) to find

bugs and improve UX. This can prevent wasted time building the wrong thing. Given limited

coding experience, user feedback is gold for guiding where to focus improvements (perhaps the

first testers say “I wish I could hear the article read aloud” – that would prioritize adding audio).

In summary, the product roadmap for Better French should start with the indispensable reading &

translation features, then layer on enhancements that drive learning efficiency (flashcards, notes) and

user retention (quizzes, streaks, gamification). Each stage should be achievable with the resources at

16


hand, using existing tools to minimize heavy coding. By benchmarking competitors, we see that the full

“wish list” of features (graded content, translations, SRS, audio, grammar notes, etc.) is indeed what

makes a rich product – but those were built by larger teams over time. The stepwise approach ensures

Better French can gradually approach feature parity with the competition while always delivering the

core value: enabling users to actually read and learn from French news on their own.

## 5. Platform Strategy – Web vs. Mobile

Deciding on platform focus is crucial for reaching Better French’s target users in the most effective way.

We analyze user device habits and outline a strategy for transitioning from a web app to native mobile

apps at the right time, as well as which platforms (iOS/Android) to prioritize.

Current Device Habits in France: Overall, France is a highly connected society with a strong preference

for mobile internet use. As of 2024, mobile devices account for about 63% of web traffic in France,

versus ~35% on desktops

42

. Smartphone penetration is very high – around 83–84% of the French

population owns a smartphone

43

, one of the highest rates globally. Among younger adults (the

cohort many non-native learners fall into), the rate is even higher (91% for 18–24 year-olds reportedly

have smartphones)

44

. This means any digital product in France must at least be mobile-friendly, if

not mobile-first. Indeed, people increasingly expect to access services on their phones. Additionally,

France had 75 million active cellular connections in early 2024 (115% of population)

45

– indicating

many  individuals  use  multiple  mobile  devices  or  SIMs,  and  generally,  connectivity  via  mobile  is

pervasive.

For Better French’s specific user personas, mobile usage is critical. International students and au pairs

practically live on their smartphones (social media, messaging, etc.); workers might use desktop at the

office but turn to phones during commutes or at home. Refugees and lower-income immigrants might

only have a smartphone for internet access – skipping a home PC entirely. (For example, many asylum

seekers rely on smartphones for translation and news – NGOs note that two-thirds of refugees are

active phone users even in camps

46

17

.) In short, the target demographic heavily uses smartphones

to access information and learn on the go.

Web App for Launch (Advantages): Initially focusing on a web application (accessible via browser) is

### wise for a few reasons:

•

Lower  Development  Overhead: A  responsive  web  app  is  platform-agnostic  –  it  works  on

Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS via the browser. A solo developer can maintain one codebase.

This  is  far  less  effort  than  developing  and  synchronizing  two  separate  native  apps  (iOS  and

Android) plus possibly a web version. For an early-stage product, the web is the fastest way to

iterate features and fix issues without app store delays.

•

Immediate Accessibility: Users can start using a web app by clicking a link – no need to install

anything. This reduces friction for  trial, which  is  crucial  when  testing  product-market  fit.  For

example, if we advertise in a Facebook expat group, providing a link “Read news in easy French

here” will get more instant engagement than asking users to find and install an app. Especially

for the initial beta user acquisition, web is ideal.

•

Easier Content Updates: The founder can update content or features continuously on web. In

contrast, mobile app updates have to go through App Store/Google Play reviews and users have

to  download  updates.  Web  allows  quick  tweaks,  A/B  testing  copy  or  layouts,  etc.,  which  is

important in these early learning stages of the business.

17


•

Desktop Use Case: Some target users (e.g. a foreign professional at their desk, or a student in

the library) may prefer to read on a larger screen. A web app covers that use case nicely. In fact,

for deep reading and study, a laptop interface can be more comfortable (e.g. having a larger

view for parallel translation, or ability to copy notes). By contrast, if we launched mobile-only,

we’d exclude those who might want to use it on a PC.

Therefore, the plan is to launch with a responsive web app that works well on mobile browsers and

desktop. The web app should be thoroughly tested on common mobile screen sizes (e.g. iPhone 13,

mid-range Android) to ensure the UX is smooth – users should be able to tap words easily, scroll, etc.,

without  pinching/zooming.  Techniques  like  responsive  design  and  possibly  a  simple  PWA  wrapper

(Progressive Web App) can make the web app feel more “app-like” on mobile (fullscreen, offline caching

of last articles, etc.).

When to Transition to Native Mobile App: We anticipate that over time, as the user base grows and

engagement patterns emerge, having native apps will be beneficial. Indicators that it’s time to invest in

### native apps include:

•

User Behavior Data: If analytics show, for instance, 70%+ of usage is on mobile devices (which is

likely)  and  users  return  frequently,  a  native  app  can  enhance  retention  through  push
notifications  and  better  performance.  We  expect  heavy  mobile  usage;  if  we  see  mobile  web

sessions per user are high and users request an app (“Does it have an app?” feedback), that’s a

sign to act.

•

Feature Demands: Certain features are smoother on native apps – e.g. audio playback in the

background, offline downloads, push notifications  for  daily new  articles  or  streak  reminders.

While some can be done via web (web push notifications exist but are less reliable, and offline

PWA functionality is limited), the experience is generally superior in a native app. If we want to

implement those deeply, that might prompt app development.

•

Credibility and Marketing: At a certain point, having an App Store presence boosts credibility

(“real” apps are often expected by consumers) and discoverability (users searching “learn French

news” in app stores). When Better French is ready for broader marketing campaigns, listing on

Google Play and Apple App Store will catch additional organic users. So as the model is validated

and ready to scale marketing, having native apps becomes more important.

Given those conditions, a possible timeline is: focus on web for the first ~6–12 months while refining the

product. Then, plan native app development after achieving initial traction (perhaps after a few

thousand  MAUs  on  web).  This  also  ensures  we  have  stable  features  and  UI  design  that  we  can

confidently translate to an app.

Android vs. iOS – Prioritization: If resources allow simultaneous development, ideally launch on both

major  platforms.  However,  if  forced  to  choose  an  order  (e.g.  only  bandwidth  to  do  one  at  a  time),

### consider the following:

•

Android  has  a  larger  user  base  both  globally  and  likely  within  our  target  in  France. In

France,  Android  holds  about 70%  market  share  of  smartphones as  of  2024

47

.  Many

immigrants  and  budget-conscious  users  use  Android  phones  (due  to  their  affordability  and

prevalence). For example, a refugee or international student from a developing country is far

more likely to own an Android device than an iPhone. Even globally, French learners in places like

West Africa, India (future expansion markets) are predominantly on Android.

18


•

iOS users, while fewer in number, often have higher spending power. In our case, that might

map to digital nomads or some professionals (e.g. North American expats) who use iPhones –

they  could  be  more  willing  to  pay  for  premium.  iOS  users  also  generate  higher  App  Store

revenue on average in many sectors. That said, given the educational/integration focus of Better

French, we cannot ignore the huge Android majority of likely users.

•

Development  considerations: Android  app  development  can  be  done  via  cross-platform

toolkits easily (React Native or Flutter covers both), but if doing native, Android might be slightly

more complex to support due to device variety. iOS has a standardized environment but strict

App Store rules (e.g. on content, payment). Also, deploying on iOS requires dealing with Apple’s

in-app  purchase  cut  and  guidelines  around  educational  apps  (nothing  problematic,  just  a

process).

A prudent approach: use a cross-platform framework so we build both together. If cross-platform is not

feasible for the founder’s skillset, then prioritize Android for initial native release (since likely >70% of

our users will be on it). Shortly after, follow with iOS – perhaps by bringing in a contractor or using a

service to convert the code.

Another possibility is releasing a public beta on Android first (Google Play allows open betas and
quicker updates), to gather feedback on the native app, then launching the polished app on iOS (where

users tend to expect more refinement and Apple’s review process may be tougher on a rough app). This

staged approach can de-risk the iOS launch.

Maintaining Web Presence: Even after mobile apps are launched, the web app should be maintained.

Many users will still discover the service via web search or may occasionally use the web version (for

instance, when on a computer at work). Additionally, web is needed for SEO and content marketing;

posting sample articles publicly could draw traffic from Google (“learn French with news” searches). The

web app can also serve as a fallback for those who can’t install apps (e.g. using a public computer at a

library or those with low phone storage). So the strategy is not to replace web with mobile, but to

augment it – offering a seamless experience: you can read on your phone app in the morning, and

maybe continue on your laptop at night, with your progress synced.

Platform-Specific Features: Once on mobile, tailor features to platform strengths: - On iOS, perhaps

integrate with Siri Shortcuts (e.g. “Hey Siri, read my French news for today” to open the app). Also, iOS

users might benefit from Share Extension (share a word to the Better French app to save it, etc.). - On

Android, possibly use intents – e.g. allow the app to open French text from other apps to translate (this

might  be  advanced,  but  Android  flexibility  is  higher).  -  Both:  use Push  Notifications smartly  –

reminders like “New easy article: ‘Elections explained’ is now available!” or “You’re 1 day away from a 7-

day streak, keep it up!” can significantly boost retention. This is one major benefit of having an app

versus just web.

Resource Considerations: For a solo dev, building two apps is challenging. Cross-platform frameworks

or progressive  web  app technology  can  mitigate  this.  A  PWA  can  be  “installed”  from  Chrome  on

Android and even on iOS (to some extent) and can send push notifications (on Android/desktop; iOS

recently began allowing web push in iOS 16). A well-made PWA might serve 80% of the native app’s

purpose initially and is much easier to deploy from a web codebase. So an interim step before fully

native could be: optimize the web app as a PWA (with offline caching and push). This could satisfy many

users and buy time until native development is viable.

19


In conclusion, the platform strategy is: 1. Launch on Web (responsive) – achieve broad immediate

reach  and  iterate  quickly.  2. Monitor  usage;  optimize  mobile  web  UX –  ensure  those  on  mobile

browsers have a near-native experience. 3. Introduce a PWA – so users can add Better French to their

home screen and get basic offline access. 4. Develop Native Apps when traction justifies it – likely

starting with Android given user distribution, followed by iOS. 5. Eventually support both iOS/Android

fully – leveraging cross-platform code to minimize maintenance overhead. 6. Keep Web as a first-class

citizen – continue improving it in parallel, as it’s crucial for accessibility and as an entry funnel.

This  staged  approach  ensures  Better  French  meets  users  on whatever  device  they  use,  without

overextending development resources prematurely. By the time the user base clamors for a dedicated

app, the product-market fit will be validated, and investing in native apps will yield clear returns in user

satisfaction and growth.

## 6. Marketing and Positioning Strategy

Crafting the right positioning and reaching the target audience through effective channels are key to

Better French’s growth. We will compare two possible value propositions for the app and recommend

which to emphasize, then outline specific marketing channels and a launch campaign to acquire and

retain users.

### Value Proposition & Positioning:

The two suggested positioning angles are: - A. “Understand France Better Through News” – framing

the app primarily as a cultural integration tool. - B. “Learn French with Contextual News” – framing it

as a language learning tool that uses news as the method.

These are not mutually exclusive (indeed the app does both), but the emphasis can significantly affect

### messaging and audience perception. Let’s examine each:

A.  “Understand  France  Better  Through  News”: This  slogan  highlights  the  outcome  of  cultural

understanding. It appeals to a user’s desire to fit into French society, to know what’s happening around

them. This positioning might attract expatriates and immigrants who are motivated by integration – for

example, someone who thinks: “I wish I could follow the French news like locals do, but it’s too hard for

me in French.” By promising to help them understand France, we tap into an emotional goal (feeling at

home in a foreign country). It’s a slightly broader pitch than language learning alone; it implies the app

is a gateway to French society and culture. This could differentiate Better French from generic language

apps – it’s not just about grammar drills, it’s about real-world knowledge.

Pros of this positioning: - Speaks to integrative motivation, which is very strong among immigrants

(the drive to be part of the community). - Could pique interest of even those who might not actively seek

a “language app”. For instance, an expat who’s not keen on doing Duolingo might still want to read

simplified news to know local happenings. - Avoids the intimidation some feel with “learning languages”

by focusing on the practical benefit (understanding news).

Cons: - It might underplay the explicit “language learning” aspect. Some who do explicitly search for

language solutions might not immediately realize the app is for improving French. - People looking to

“learn French” might skip over something marketed as a news service or think “I need a course, not

news”. - It may appeal more to those already in France; a global learner in say the US might not care

about “understand France” as much as “learn French effectively.”

20


B.  “Learn  French  with  Contextual  News”: This  tagline  directly  identifies  as  a language  learning

solution (“Learn French”). It tells learners that the method is via contextualized news, implying it might

be more engaging or effective than traditional methods. This is attractive to people actively trying to

learn  French  and  looking  for  innovative  approaches.  It  clearly  places  Better  French  in  the  edtech/

language-learning category.

Pros: - Captures those searching for “learn French” resources – good for SEO/ASO, as those keywords

are popular (e.g. “learn French app”). - Emphasizes the unique method (contextual news), which might

intrigue learners tired of rote memorization. It suggests a modern, content-based approach. - Works

globally: a student in India or the US not particularly concerned with French current affairs might still

use  it  because  it’s  marketed  as  a  superior  way  to  learn  the  language.  -  Sets  the  expectation  that

language improvement is the goal, aligning user mindset to treat it as a learning tool and possibly track

progress (appealing to serious learners).

Cons: - Might sound a bit like an academic or specific approach – some casual expats might think “I’m

not  looking  for  a  study  tool;  I  just  want  to  understand  the  news.”  They  might  not  realize  it’s  built

precisely to help them do that. - Could pigeonhole the app alongside traditional language apps in users’

minds; we risk comparisons on aspects like grammar coverage or exercises, whereas our differentiator

is content. We’d need to be clear how “with contextual news” makes it different/better.

Recommended Positioning: Ideally, Better French can blend these two angles to maximize appeal:

positioning it as the app that helps you learn French and integrate, by reading the news. A combined value

proposition might be: “Learn French in Context – Understand France through Simplified News.”

This marries both ideas. In marketing copy, we can use a headline and subheader to hit both points

(e.g. headline focusing on learning French, subheader mentioning integrating/understanding culture).

If we have to pick one emphasis, lean slightly towards “Learn French with News” when marketing in

language-learning  channels  (because  people  there  are  looking  for  French  tools),  and  use  the

“Understand France” angle in integration-focused channels (like expat forums, refugee programs). We

can tailor messaging per channel: - For example, on an expat Facebook ad: “Feel lost reading French

news? Better French helps you understand France by simplifying today’s headlines – with translations

and tips for non-natives.” - On a Google search ad for “French learning app”: “Learn French with Real

News  –  contextual  articles,  instant  translations,  cultural  notes.  Ditch  flashcards,  learn  from  the

headlines.”

This  nuanced  approach  ensures  resonance  with  different  segments.  Overall,  I  suggest  the primary

tagline publicly be oriented towards learning (so people immediately get it’s educational), with a strong

secondary promise of cultural immersion. Essentially: “Learn French through real news – bridging

language and culture.” This communicates that by using it, you not only learn language (explicit) but

also keep up with French culture (implicit/explicit).

### Marketing Channels:

1.

### Social Media (Short-form video and influencers):

2.

TikTok and Instagram Reels: These platforms are booming for language learning content.

There are numerous micro-influencers teaching French phrases, explaining French culture, etc.,

with large followings (hundreds of thousands of followers)

48

. For example, accounts like “Learn

French with Alexa” (321k TikTok followers)

49

or “@encorefrenchlessons” on TikTok cater exactly

to our audience

50

. Better French can collaborate with such creators – e.g., sponsor a few

videos where the influencer highlights the app (“Here’s my hack to improve French – reading

21


news on Better French app!” possibly demonstrating it). Alternatively, the founder can create a

TikTok account for Better French, sharing quick language tips drawn from news (“Today’s French

Headline & Vocab: [headline], learn 3 words...”). TikTok’s algorithm can get this content in front of

interested learners if done consistently. The key is making it entertaining: leveraging trending

audio, memes but with a language twist. Many younger learners (18–30) use TikTok for language

learning tips, as shown by the popularity of #learnfrench content

51

. This channel can both

build brand awareness and directly drive downloads via link-in-bio or TikTok’s App Profile.

3.

YouTube (for longer content): A YouTube channel could host weekly “Easy French News”

segments (like 5-minute summaries of simple news). This is similar to the concept of News in Slow

French, except maybe with on-screen text and translation. YouTube is the second largest search

engine; people might search “French news with subtitles” or “simple French news”. By posting

such content and mentioning the app, we could attract organic interest. Additionally, partnering

with existing YouTube channels (like InnerFrench, which does podcasts on French culture in

simpler French, or others) for shout-outs or sponsorship could tap into their audience. For

instance, InnerFrench’s audience of intermediate learners would likely love Better French as a

complementary tool.

4.

Facebook Groups and Communities: There are active Facebook groups for expats and French

learners. For example, “Expats in Paris” has 50k members

52

, “Americans in Paris”, “Learning

French” groups, etc. A strategy is to join these groups and genuinely engage – not spamming,

but providing value (e.g., share a link to a free simplified news article from Better French’s blog

with “Thought this might help those struggling with French news” – including the citation of our

content). Many group rules forbid outright advertising, but if we become a helpful member (or

coordinate with admins to maybe allow a promo in exchange for something), we can gain users.

Also, specialized groups like those for international students (Erasmus networks, Campus France

alumni groups) are channels; posting around semester start when students arrive could get

attention (“New tool for improving French by reading local news – free for students to try!”).

5.

Reddit: Subreddits such as r/learnfrench (142k members)

53

and r/French (for French

language discussion) are valuable. Marketing here must be subtle and community-aligned. A

possible approach is an AMA (“I built a tool to simplify French news for learners – ask me

anything about learning with news”), or just responding to threads where people ask “How can I

practice reading in French?” by mentioning Better French if appropriate (with transparency about

affiliation). Redditors appreciate free value, so perhaps sharing one free article in r/learnfrench

as an example could drive them to check out the site. Also, r/FrenchLearning on Discord or other

forums is another place to spread by word-of-mouth.

6.

Language Learning Influencers on Twitter/LinkedIn: There are language coaches on Twitter

who share tips (though French learning Twitter is smaller). LinkedIn could be used to target

professionals (e.g., an article on “Language integration in France for expat workers” with a link to

the app), but likely lower yield than consumer channels.

7.

### Content Marketing & SEO:

8.

Blog and SEO: Better French can maintain a blog with articles targeting relevant keywords: “best

way to learn French through news”, “French for immigrants resources”, “easy French news daily”,

etc. For example, an article “Top 5 Resources to Learn French with News” could mention Better

French as #1 and also reference News in Slow French, RFI’s easy news, etc., to attract searchers

and build credibility. Search engine traffic for terms like “simplified French news” might be

modest but high-converting, since those users exactly need our solution. We already see queries

like “how to use news to learn French”

54

and blog posts about it – we can contribute content in

that space to draw eyes.

22


9.

The blog can also share success stories or interviews (e.g., “How Maria mastered French in 6

months with news reading”). Such human-interest angles resonate and can be shared on social

media.

10.

Multilingual outreach: Consider writing a couple of blog posts in English and possibly other

languages (for instance, a Spanish article like “Aprender francés con noticias fáciles” to target

Spanish-speakers in France or Latin Americans interested in French). Since many immigrants

may search in English or their native language for French-learning tips, having some content

indexed in those languages could funnel them to us.

11.

We should ensure the website SEO is strong: meta tags, keywords like “learn French”, “French

news  easy”,  etc.  The  Institut  Français  survey  found  interest  in  French  globally  and  identified

obstacles like difficulty

16

– we can frame our site to appear as a solution to “French is difficult”

queries.

12.

### University and School Outreach:

13.

International Student Networks: Partner with organizations like Campus France, Erasmus

Student Network (ESN), or university international student offices. For example, ESN often holds

orientation for Erasmus students – Better French could provide flyers or a short demo during

orientation (“Here’s an app to help you follow French news while you’re here”). Campus France

(the official body) might feature useful tools on their site or social media; if we create a press

release or a compelling pitch, they might mention Better French as an innovative tool for

international students in France (especially if we highlight alignment with the “Bienvenue en

France” initiative to welcome students).

14.

Alliances Françaises and Language Schools: The Alliance Française has branches worldwide

teaching French – while they have their own curricula, they often appreciate supplemental

resources for students. We could reach out to local Alliance chapters in France (which sometimes

run integration courses for newcomers) or even ones abroad (for expansion) to see if they’d

recommend Better French to their students for extra reading practice. Even a simple flyer on

their bulletin board or a mention in their newsletter could drive adoption.

15.

NGOs  and  government  integration  programs: There  are  nonprofits  and  government-

sponsored  programs  for  refugees  and  immigrants  (OFII,  etc.).  Offering  the  app  free  to  their

beneficiaries  or  doing  a  workshop  could  both  do  good  and  spread  word-of-mouth.  If,  for

instance, an NGO tutor finds it useful, they might recommend it to dozens of learners. This falls

under both marketing and perhaps CSR partnership. It might not yield revenue immediately (if

given free), but it builds user base and goodwill – which helps in the long run for network effects

and even PR.

16.

### Paid Advertising:

17.

Google Ads: We can run AdWords targeting keywords like “learn French online”, “French reading

practice”. Since those keywords are competitive (Babbel, Duolingo likely bid on them), we might

target longer-tail queries like “French newspaper for learners” or “French easy news translation”.

These will have lower volume but also lower cost and more specific intent. Also target location-

based keywords like “French for foreigners in France” – people already in France searching in

English for help.

18.

Facebook/Instagram Ads: Can target by location and interests. For example, show ads to

people in France who have recently moved (Facebook allows targeting expats or people with

language not equal to country’s language). We could specifically target say, “lived in France < 1

year” or “Interested in French language”. A creative ad could show e.g. a split image of a real

23


French newspaper (dense text) versus a simplified one with translations, with headline “French

news doesn’t have to be intimidating – try Better French.” The copy might say “Struggling to read

the French news? Better French delivers simplified news articles with instant translations –

perfect for immigrants, students and expats. Turn French news into your daily language lesson.”

19.

LinkedIn Ads: If targeting professional expats, LinkedIn could reach people who list France as

location but have foreign education/work – likely expats. However, LinkedIn ads are pricey and

perhaps better for B2B (if we target HR departments to offer to expat employees?). Probably not

a primary channel for now, given budget constraints.

20.

### PR & Positioning:

21.

Press Releases/Media: We could get media coverage by pitching the story: e.g. “New web app

helps non-Francophones integrate by simplifying French news.” French media like The Local

France (an English news site for expats) or Connexion might find this interesting for their

readership. Also, tech blogs or newsletters that cover edtech or integration could give a shout.

Since integration of immigrants is a hot topic in France, a tool that aids language learning

through news has a positive angle. We might back it with data: “X hundred thousand foreigners

struggle with French – Better French’s mission is to close the gap by enabling them to read news

with ease.” If any local government or association endorses us or uses us, that can be mentioned

for credibility.

22.

Positioning messaging: We should refine a short elevator pitch that encapsulates the unique

value. E.g. “Better French is like having a French teacher and a news editor in your pocket – it

turns real French news into bite-sized, understandable lessons. We help you not just learn the

language, but also what’s happening in France.” This messaging can be used consistently across

website, social, PR to cement what we stand for.

### Launch Campaign Idea:

For launching (especially public launch outside a small beta), a campaign that creates initial buzz and

### user engagement is needed:

•

“Understand the News” Challenge: We could run a 2-week challenge where users sign up and

commit to reading one simplified news article a day. We partner with a popular French-learning

YouTuber  or  TikToker  who  acts  as  the  host  of  the  challenge.  Participants  get  free  premium

access for that period as an incentive. They share their progress on social media (maybe with a

hashtag like #BetterFrenchChallenge). We can encourage posting a new word they learned or a

headline they understood for the first time. This user-generated content spreads awareness. At

the end, those who completed (read every day) could get a certificate or enter a prize draw

(maybe  for  a  French  book  or  a  6-month  app  subscription).  This  leverages  community  and

accountability to get the initial cohort really using the app – and talking about it.

•

Referral Launch: Implement a referral program from the start: “Invite a friend, and both of you

get an extra month free.” This can turn one curious user into a mini-marketer for us. Immigrants

often  cluster  (one  student  will  tell  their  classmates,  an  expat  tells  their  colleague  who  also

struggles with French). By providing a benefit for referrals, we can harness these small networks.

Perhaps early adopters become “Better French Ambassadors” unofficially.

•

Student Ambassador Program: For campuses with many international students, recruit a few

volunteers  or  reps  (perhaps  in  exchange  for  a  year’s  free  premium  or  a  small  stipend)  to

24


promote the app among their peers. They could host a short info session or distribute flyers at

international student meet-ups. Students are often receptive to peer recommendations.

•

Content Teasers on Social: Leading up to launch, post a few teaser “Did you know?” facts on

social media. For instance: “Did you know 65% of French learners find the news too hard to

understand? We’re changing that. #BetterFrenchComingSoon”. Or share an example snippet of

an  article  pre-  and  post-simplification  to  show  the  concept.  This  builds  intrigue  and  visually

communicates what we do.

•

Leverage  Existing  Language  Communities: For  example,  coordinate  with  moderators  of  r/

learnfrench for a launch-day AMA or pinned post introduction (if allowed), or with admins of a

large Facebook expat group to allow a one-time intro post. Offer exclusive promo codes to these

communities to track uptake from each (like “LEARNREDDIT” for Reddit users gets 2 months free

premium if they join within launch week, etc.). Communities love getting exclusives or discounts.

•

“Free for First 1000” Offer: A tactic to spur urgency could be: “The first 1000 users to sign up get

3 months premium free.” This can be broadcast on all channels. People rush to not miss out, and

if they find value in those 3 months, many will convert to paid afterward. It also gives us a critical

mass of users to generate activity, feedback, and word-of-mouth.

•

Language Teachers Outreach: Contact influential French teachers/bloggers (like those who run

popular websites or have email newsletters, e.g. Lawless French, Comme une Française blog,

etc.) and offer them free access to test the app. If they like it, they might mention it to their

audience or students. Perhaps propose an affiliate arrangement where if their referred users

subscribe, they get a cut – that can motivate them to promote it. For instance, a teacher with an

email list of French learners might write a review of Better French, highlighting how it helps with

reading practice.

•

Brand Voice and Consistency: Through all these efforts, maintain a tone that resonates with

our  audience:  encouraging,  friendly,  and  empowering.  We  should  avoid  overly  academic  or

corporate tone. Instead, “We get it – French news can be intimidating. We’re here to simplify it

for you, one article at a time” – this kind of empathetic voice in marketing copy will connect with

users’ pain point (intimidation) and position us as a helpful friend.

Lastly, as the user base grows, encourage user stories and testimonials. For marketing, nothing is as

persuasive as someone like them saying “Thanks to Better French, I could finally follow a TV debate in

French!” or “After 3 months using it, I passed my B1 exam – and I actually know what’s going on in the

news.”  We  should  collect  these  and  share  them  (with  permission)  on  the  website  and  socials.  This

reinforces both the “learn French” and “understand France” aspects with real outcomes.

By leveraging targeted social channels (especially TikTok/Instagram for younger and Facebook/Reddit

for expats), content marketing, and strategic partnerships, Better French can achieve a strong launch

and  steady  organic  growth.  The  positioning  should  emphasize  that  we uniquely  combine  language

learning with staying informed, which sets us apart from generic apps and appeals deeply to our niche.

The recommended marketing mix is relatively low-budget, relying on community engagement, virality,

and partnerships more than large ad spends – appropriate for a startup. As we see traction, we can

double down on the channels yielding the best ROI (e.g. maybe TikTok content goes viral, then invest

more in that, or if Facebook ads convert well among a certain expat demographic, scale that). The key is

to  remain  agile,  track  metrics  (click-throughs,  sign-ups  from  each  channel),  and  refine  the  strategy

accordingly.

## 7. Expansion Potential

Looking  beyond  France,  Better  French  can  tap  into  the global  market  of  French  learners and

Francophiles.  While  the  initial  focus  is  on  non-native  residents  in  France,  the  platform’s  core  value
(news-based French learning) is applicable to anyone learning French, regardless of location. We outline

a plan for expanding internationally and identify high-potential markets with supporting data.

Global French Learner Landscape: French is one of the world’s most studied languages (often ranked

second  or  third  after  English  and  Spanish).  There  are  approximately 300  million  French  speakers

worldwide (including  second-language  speakers)

55

,  and  this  number  is  projected  to  grow

dramatically – possibly to 750 million by 2050 according to one projection, largely due to population

growth  in  Francophone  Africa

55

.  This  means  the pool  of  French  learners will  also  grow,  as  French

remains a key language in diplomacy, business, and education. French is taught in schools across the

globe: for instance, in U.S. K-12 schools, around 1.25 million students were enrolled in French classes

(data from late 2000s)

56

, making it the #2 foreign language in American schools after Spanish. In

Canada, outside Quebec, 2.5 million young Canadians study French as a second language, including

nearly 483,000 in immersion programs

57

– reflecting huge interest due to Canada’s bilingual policies.

In India, French is the most popular foreign language taught in schools and universities, often a top

choice for students alongside German and Spanish

58

59

. And as a further example, Nigeria (Africa’s

largest  Anglophone  country)  has  introduced  French  in  its  curriculum  as  a  secondary  language  to

improve regional integration, given all its neighbors are Francophone. These numbers show there is a

massive worldwide audience striving to learn French – far beyond the tens of thousands actually residing

in France.

### Key Expansion Markets:

•

West Africa: West and Central Africa collectively have the largest number of French speakers in

the  world,  primarily  due  to  former  French  colonies.  Countries  like  Senegal,  Côte  d’Ivoire,

Cameroon, D.R. Congo, etc., use French as an official language. While many people there speak

French to some degree (especially the educated population), the proficiency can vary and French

often exists alongside local languages. There’s likely a significant segment of people in these

countries who view French as the language of upward mobility or who want to improve their

formal  French  (for  education  or  jobs).  Moreover,  countries  like Nigeria  and  Ghana (non-

Francophone countries in West Africa) have a strong push for learning French to better engage

in regional commerce – the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) encourages

bilingualism.  For  example,  Nigeria  reportedly  has  hundreds  of  thousands  of  students  taking

French in secondary schools as a compulsory subject for some years

60

. Expansion in West

Africa could mean providing content that might sometimes include Africa-related French news

(to increase relevance), and ensuring the app works on low-bandwidth mobile networks (which is

common in Africa). The sheer number of potential users is huge – Africa’s youth population is

large and growing, and French is a common second language aspiration. The OIF (Organisation

Internationale de la Francophonie) notes Africa will account for the majority of French speakers

by 2050

55

. A tool like Better French could be extremely useful in educational systems there

(e.g. as a supplement in high schools or universities to practice reading). We might consider

partnerships with telecom companies or edu-tech initiatives in Africa to distribute the app (for

instance,  Orange  (a  French  telecom)  operates  in  many  African  countries  and  often  supports

digital education content).

•

North America (USA & Canada): In the United States, French has long been a popular foreign

language in high schools and colleges. While interest has fluctuated, it remains the second most

26


enrolled language at colleges (135k enrollments in 2021 in US universities)

61

, and millions have

some exposure in K-12. There is a community of American French learners (through Alliance

Française chapters, online communities, etc.) who often look for ways to maintain or improve

their French after formal classes. Better French can position itself as a solution for intermediate

learners who want real content instead of textbooks. Also, the U.S. has a sizeable population of

former French immersion students or ex-expats from France who might use such an app to keep

up. Canada is even more directly relevant: outside Quebec, many English-speaking Canadians

learn  French  due  to  official  bilingualism  requirements  for  government  jobs  and  a  general

cultural  push.  There  were  about 3.8  million  French  second-language  students  in  Canada

(K-12) at one point, with immersion programs booming

57

62

. Additionally, many Canadians

regularly consume news in French (e.g., federal civil servants are encouraged to practice French).

Better  French  could  target  Canadian  users  by  perhaps  incorporating  some  Canadian  French

news (for example, a simplified CBC/Radio-Canada article occasionally). It’s worth noting that

Canadian French has differences; while the app likely uses metropolitan (France) French as a

base, Canadian learners will still find it beneficial. Marketing in North America can highlight:

“Keep your French fresh by reading daily news – short, simple, and with translations at a tap.”

•

United Kingdom and Europe: The UK has a tradition of French learning (though it declined in

recent years in schools, many Brits still learn French as adults for travel or leisure). Also, there

are  British  expatriates  living  in  France  (and  other  Francophone  countries  like  Switzerland,

Belgium)  who  could  use  the  app  –  although  that  overlaps  with  our  initial  demo  in  France.

Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain all have significant numbers of students learning

French (as a second foreign language often). For example, within the EU, French is commonly

taught at various levels. These European learners might be interested in French current events

as well due to proximity. The expansion in Europe would revolve around marketing the app as a

reading practice tool – possibly collaborating with European language institutes or leveraging

the fact that many of these learners already have decent internet access and incomes to pay for

apps.

•

South Asia (India): India stands out as a country where French is very popular as a foreign

language. Indian schools (especially CBSE board and many private schools) offer French from

middle school onward, and there are tens of thousands of university students doing B.A. or

certificates in French. With globalization,  many  Indians  learn  French  to  work  in  international

companies  or  to  go  abroad  (France  has  become  a  study  destination  –  about  10,000  Indian

students in France currently, expected to rise to 20,000+ by 2025

63

). Better French could cater

to advanced Indian students who have learned grammar in class and now want practical reading

practice. They may not be super interested in daily French political news, but might enjoy, say,

simplified news about French technology, lifestyle, or international news reported from a French

perspective. Given India’s huge youth population and smartphone penetration (and comfort with

e-learning – millions use apps like Duolingo, which in India French is the #3 language studied on

the platform ), this is a promising market. Price sensitivity is somewhat higher, so perhaps a

64

lower-cost tier or student pricing in these regions could be considered, or focus on ad-supported

free usage.

•

### Other Francophone or Francophile regions:

•

Middle East (e.g., Lebanon, Egypt): Lebanon has French as a co-official language and many

Lebanese might use the app for formal practice (though many are fluent). Egypt has a large

French-educated elite and many students in French schools – they might find it useful.

•

Asia-Pacific: Countries like Vietnam have historical French ties and some continue to learn

French; also, China has a growing number of French learners (tens of thousands of university

27


students in French programs, plus those who plan to study in France). Marketing to China would

be unique (closed apps environment), but Chinese students who go to France could be targeted

while they are in France.

•

West Indies/Oceania: Places like Haiti (Creole/French), some Pacific islands – smaller markets

but part of Francophonie. Possibly not a primary focus, but open usage.

Product Adjustments for Expansion: To appeal beyond France-focused content, the app can diversify

news topics to include more internationally relevant stories (still in French, but not only about French

domestic affairs). For instance, it might include a “International” section (French perspective on global

news) or human-interest stories that any French learner would find interesting, not just those living in

France  (e.g.,  a  simplified  article  about  the  Notre-Dame  restoration  –  culturally  interesting  globally).

However, our core differentiation is still actual French context, so we won’t stray far from authentic

French sources.

One idea for expansion: create “editions” or content filters. A user in West Africa might have an option

to  get  some  Africa-related  French  news  in  their  feed  (perhaps  from Jeune  Afrique or  local  sources)

simplified. A Canadian user might toggle a “Canada” filter to see occasional Canadian French articles.

This might be a later-stage feature if content production allows.

Marketing in New Markets: Once we go beyond France-resident marketing channels, we’d shift to

channels relevant to French learners in those regions: - Partnering with Alliance Française branches

globally (they have hundreds of thousands of students collectively). - Online, target interest groups: for

example, in India, target college students  in French  departments  via  Instagram  or  collaborate  with

French cultural center in New Delhi. - For the US, join language learning communities (like r/French on

Duolingo forums, or Discord language groups). - Possibly translate parts of our marketing site to other

languages  to  welcome  non-English  speakers  who  are  learning  French  (e.g.,  Spanish,  Portuguese

marketing  pages).  -  Emphasize  the  benefit  as  per  persona:  an  American  might  do  it  to  “keep  your

French fresh between classes”, an African user might see it as “improve your formal French reading

skills for career or exams”.

Future  Languages  /  Replication: Though  not  asked  explicitly,  an  expansion  potential  is  also  to

replicate the model for other languages once French is proven. The concept of “Better [Language]” for

contextual news learning could apply to Spanish, German, etc. The skillset and tech would carry over.

However, each language is a whole new content endeavor, so likely not immediate. But it’s worth noting

investors or partners might see scalability in that direction too (e.g., “Better Spanish” for expats in Latin

America, etc.).

### Data to Support Key Markets:

•

Francophone Africa: Of the 300 million French speakers today, 96.2 million are in Africa (as of

a 2018 OIF report), and Africa’s share is growing fastest

55

. Many of those are second-language

speakers educated in French. If even a fraction of them (students, professionals) use an app to

sharpen their French, that’s a huge user base. For example, Ivory Coast’s official reports show

French literacy improving but many still prefer simpler French materials for learning –

anecdotally, “easy French news” would have audience in such places (source: educational studies,

though specific citation might be niche).

•

Canada: Official bilingualism: ~8 million native French speakers (mostly in Quebec) and about

2.4 million non-Francophone Canadians report being able to speak French (2016 census).

Moreover, as noted, nearly half a million students in English Canada do immersion (so by high

school they can read intermediate French)

57

. Those immersion grads often seek ways to

maintain French after school – Better French could be pitched as a fun way to keep up using

28


current events instead of textbooks. Also, for Canadian federal job exams (which test ability to

read French), practicing with news is great – a niche but real use-case.

•

USA: The interest in French in US, while overshadowed by Spanish, remains significant. The

Modern Language Association data indicates French is the second-most studied language in

higher ed

65

. Also, French AP (Advanced Placement) exam takers in high school were ~18,000 in

2021 (compared to ~150k for Spanish) – indicating a population of serious teen learners in the

tens of thousands each year. Many Americans learn French for travel or personal enrichment too

(e.g., people who love French culture, planning trips, etc., could enjoy reading news to practice).

•

India: Hard figures are scarce, but given Alliance Française network in India teaches ~100,000

students annually across 20+ centers (estimated from AF reports) and many more in formal

education, the number of French learners in India could be in the high hundreds of thousands. A

sign of demand: French is consistently recommended as a top foreign language for Indians to

learn  for  career  prospects

66

.  India’s  booming  smartphone  market  (over  750  million

smartphone users) and comfort with e-learning (e.g., BYJU’s, etc.) mean a digital tool for French

has fertile ground.

•

West Africa (specific example): In Nigeria, which is positioning to become bilingual, there are

around 1.2 million students learning French (according to Nigeria’s ministry of education stats

a few years back) – if an app could capture even a slice, it’s worthwhile. Nigeria is also cited as
one of the pilot countries in the Institut Français Ipsos survey where interest in French is high

(the survey found young people and lower socio-economic groups in Nigeria are among the

most  enthusiastic  about  learning  French

67

,  driven  by  mobility  and  job  prospects).  This

suggests an app like ours, if adapted to their level, could see uptake.

### Adaptation and Localization:

Expanding  will  require  some  localization:  -  The French  used in  our  explanations  might  need  slight

adjustment for audience (e.g. using more international French vs. specifically France slang). But since

our  platform  language  (translations,  grammar  notes)  is  in  English  currently,  we  might  consider

translating our UI and notes into other base languages eventually (for instance, a Spanish speaker

might prefer Spanish translations of French words). That’s a non-trivial expansion but could open the

app to huge markets (Latin America, etc.). Initially, keeping English as the base is fine as English is the

common  second  language  for  many  educated  French  learners  globally  (e.g.,  Indians,  Africans,

Europeans often know English). - We might add content relevant to other locales to keep them hooked:

e.g., if a big event happens in a Francophone African country that lots of African learners want to read

about, include an article on it. - Pricing strategy for expansion: we might adjust subscription prices to

local purchasing power (Duolingo does some regional pricing). For example, a lower price tier in India

or Africa, possibly ad-supported free as main in those areas with a smaller premium tier. Alternatively,

focus on high-ARPU markets (North America, Europe) to monetize and allow freer access in developing

regions as a growth strategy.

### Key Market Highlight Summary (with data):

•

France (current core): ~7.3 million immigrants + hundreds of thousands of int’l students

5

–

immediate TAM of ~3–4 million non-francophones in need.

•

Rest of world (future TAM): ~50 million people globally learning French as a foreign language

(estimated from various sources: 2.5M in Canada, millions in Africa, ~1M in USA schools, etc.). To

illustrate: The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a 2018 report noted “French is taught to

around 90 million students and 2 million teachers worldwide”. Even if we target the subset at an

intermediate level who could benefit from news reading – say 10–20% of those – that’s still ~10

29


million potential users globally. So the expansion potential is an order of magnitude larger than

the France-resident niche.

Better French’s approach can be its passport to these markets. By proving the model in France (the

toughest testing ground in some ways, because those users have urgent needs and direct content

relevance), we refine the product. Then for global learners, using it might be even more voluntary/fun,

which is good for retention as well. The cultural hook of learning about France might especially attract

users in distant countries who romanticize French culture.

Finally, expansion will also strengthen the product for core users: more content, possibly userbase to

help with community features etc. And it opens opportunities for partnerships with global organizations

(OIF, Institut Français, etc., which fund French language promotion projects). We could, for instance,

partner with Institut Français to push Better French to the 12 countries they surveyed in 2024 (like they

did a study in e.g. Nigeria, Colombia, etc. on French perception

68

69

; we can tie into those findings by

addressing the cited barriers: difficulty and cost

16

).

In summary, expanding beyond France is a natural next step once the product is validated. The key

markets identified – West Africa, Canada, the U.S., India (and generally globally) – are supported by data

indicating high numbers of French learners or speakers needing practice. By localizing content and

marketing and possibly pricing appropriately, Better French can significantly broaden its user base and

impact. The strategy would turn Better French from a niche integration app into a globally recognized

French-learning platform, which not only grows the business but also furthers its mission of making

French accessible through real-world context.

Overall, the expansion is an exciting avenue, but it should be timed appropriately (likely after securing a

solid foothold and processes with the France-focused segment) so that quality remains high as we scale

to meet the needs of diverse French learners worldwide.
