# 🤖 AI Engine v5 - Autonomous French News Curation

**The Next Generation: Fully Autonomous, Intelligent, and Self-Contained**

AI Engine v5 represents a complete architectural revolution in the Better French system, solving key problems with a **separated workflow approach** that runs autonomously without human intervention.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: Separated Workflows

### Problem Solved
Previous versions suffered from:
- 🔄 Repeated scraping during development/testing
- 📊 Bulk processing issues (1000+ articles)
- 🕐 Time-consuming manual operations
- 💸 Unpredictable costs
- 🧠 "Heat wave spam" - repetitive similar articles

```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1. 🤖 Autonomous Scraper (Hourly)
- **Purpose**: Minimal, fast news collection
- **Frequency**: Every hour (Paris time)
- **Process**:
  1. ✅ Check if current hour already processed
  2. 📡 Scrape French news sources (7 RSS feeds)
  3. 🧠 Use Gemini 2.5 Flash to select top 10 articles
  4. 💾 Store in single `scraper_data.json` file
  5. ⏭️ Exit (no heavy processing)

### 2. 🌐 Website Processor (File Detection)
- **Purpose**: Apply V3+V4 enhancement pipeline
- **Frequency**: Every 30 minutes
- **Process**:
  1. 🔍 Detect unprocessed articles from scraper
  2. 🤖 Apply V3 enhancement (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
  3. ✨ Apply V4 enhancement (GPT-4o mini)
  4. 🌐 Generate enhanced website
  5. 📝 Mark articles as processed

### 3. 📦 Single File Data Management
- **`scraper_data.json`**: Contains everything
  - Scraper state (last processed hour)
  - Collected articles by hour
  - Processing status flags
  - Cost tracking
- **Benefits**: Clean, predictable, easy to debug

## 🎯 Benefits for Developers

### ✅ Autonomous Operation
- Scraper runs every hour regardless of development work
- No more repeated scraping during testing
- Work with stored hourly data for development
- Predictable costs and processing

### ✅ Separated Concerns
- **Scraper**: Fast, minimal LLM usage
- **Processor**: Heavy enhancement only when needed
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Independent scaling and optimization

### ✅ Robust Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks at every step
- Placeholder mode for development
- Cost tracking and limits
- Detailed logging and status

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install AI Engine v5 (self-contained)
cd ai_engine_v5
pip install -e .

# Set environment variables
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export AI_ENGINE_SELECTION_MODEL="google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
export AI_ENGINE_V3_MODEL="google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
export AI_ENGINE_V4_MODEL="openai/gpt-4o-mini"
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Autonomous Mode (Production)
The system runs automatically via GitHub Actions:
- **Scraper**: `.github/workflows/data_collection.yml` (hourly)
- **Processor**: `.github/workflows/ai_processing.yml` (every 30 min)

### Manual Testing (Development)
```python
from ai_engine_v5.core.scraper.autonomous_scraper import AutonomousScraper
from ai_engine_v5.core.processor.website_processor import WebsiteProcessor

# Test scraper
scraper = AutonomousScraper()
candidates = scraper.scrape_current_hour()
result = scraper.llm_select_top_10(candidates)

# Test processor
processor = WebsiteProcessor()
enhanced, cost = processor.enhance_articles(result['selected_articles'])
website = processor.generate_website(enhanced)
```

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Hourly Scraper ➜ scraper_data.json ➜ Website Processor ➜ Enhanced Website
     ⬇️                    ⬇️                  ⬇️              ⬇️
📡 RSS feeds         💾 Single file      🧠 V3+V4 pipeline  🌐 betterfrench.io/v5-site/
🤖 LLM selection     📊 Status tracking  ✨ Enhancement      📱 Mobile-friendly
💰 $0.01-0.05       🕐 Hour tracking    💰 $0.10-0.50      🎨 Modern UI
```

## 🎛️ Configuration

    "https://www.lemonde.fr/rss/une.xml",
    "https://www.lefigaro.fr/rss/figaro_une.xml",
    # ... 7 total sources
]
SELECTION_MODEL = "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"  # Fast, cheap
HOURLY_LIMIT = 10  # Articles per hour
```

### Processor Settings
