# Better French Website

A minimalist, Steve Jobs-inspired website that presents daily French news headlines in simplified format for French learners and native speakers.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚡ One-Command Setup (Recommended)
```bash
cd better-french-website && python3 -m http.server 8000 & sleep 2 && open http://localhost:8000
```
**This single command will:**
- Navigate to the website directory
- Start the web server on port 8000
- Wait for server to start
- Automatically open your browser to the website

### 🌐 Manual Setup
```bash
# From the project root, navigate to website folder
cd better-french-website

# Start local web server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open browser manually
open http://localhost:8000
# or visit: http://localhost:8000
```

### 🛑 To Stop Server
```bash
pkill -f "python3 -m http.server 8000"
```

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **"Address already in use" error**: Run the stop command above first
- **"File not found" errors**: Make sure you're in the `better-french-website` directory
