# Legacy AI-Engine Snapshots

This folder stores **production** versions of `scripts/AI-Engine.py` that were live on the `main` branch *before* we merged a newer AI engine.

Naming convention:
```
AI-Engine_<YYYY-MM-DD>_main.py
```
Each file is a verbatim copy from the `main` branch on that date. Use it to roll back quickly if a new engine causes problems.

Do **not** place work-in-progress or experimental engines here; only snapshots that were already in production.
