# AI-Engine v2 (Legacy)

This version of Better-French AI-Engine is **frozen** as of 2025-06-19 and kept only for historical reference.

All active development, QA, and deployments now target **ai_engine_v3**.

GitHub Actions and other CI jobs have been switched to use v3 exclusively.

If you really need to run v2 locally:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/run_ai_v2.py  # legacy entry-point
```
